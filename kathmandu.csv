Heading not Found,Dil Kumar Ale Magar,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"With a bit of luck Nepal’s fairytale victory would have been secured. The country’s hopes of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup ended after they lost to cricketing powerhouse South Africa by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller in their Group D match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent on Saturday. But their spirited performance earned praise worldwide after almost pulling off an upset win over one of the tournament favourites. Fielding first after winning the toss, the Rhinos restricted a strong Proteas team to a subpar 115-7 with their stupendous spin attack as Dipendra Singh Airee and part-time bowler Kushal Bhurtel shared all seven wickets that fell between them on a turning track. But they fell agonisingly short from recording their historic first ever victory over an ICC’s full-member nation after they could only manage 114-7. Despite the heartbreak, Nepal’s performance caught attention worldwide. “A performance to be proud of. Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter. South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show. “It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.” Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them. “Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.” Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!” “Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?” ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.” At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player. After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result. “We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.” He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].” Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage. Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries. But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase. Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game. Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings. Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand. After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs. But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls. Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat. Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls. Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Sompal Kami consoles Gulsan Jha (right) after Nepal lost their T20 World Cup Group D match against South Africa in Kingstown on Saturday. Hemanta Shrestha/TKP Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target. Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts. Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end. Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings. South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over. Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket. South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control. Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next. South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings. Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls. Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell. “I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said. South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling. “First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said. The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets. South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches. Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note. Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round. The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group.",https://kathmandupost.com/cricket/2024/06/16/nepal-lose-to-south-africa-win-over-the-world,cricket

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal’s unemployment rate has been increasing, according to a report. The fourth Nepal Living Standard Survey report, published by the National Statistics Office on Thursday, shows that the unemployment rate climbed up to 12.6 percent in 2022-23 from 11.4 percent in 2017-18, representing a 1.2 percent rise in the five-year period. The unemployment rate has risen from 4.9 percent in 1995-96 to 12.6 percent in 2022-23. This rise is more pronounced among younger workers, with the unemployment rate for those aged 15-24 jumping from 7.3 percent in 1995-96 to 22.7 percent in 2022-23. The report said this highlights the challenge of finding jobs for youths in Nepal. The survey report shows joblessness among people between the ages of 15 and 24 declined to 22.7 percent in 2022-23 from 23.9 percent in 2017-18. “Most worrying is the rise in unemployment in the past five years, which increased by 1.2 percent, and that’s worrisome,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the statistics office. “The economy has failed to generate enough jobs for its large and expanding young population.” The population structure has shifted towards a younger working-age population, with a decrease in the proportion of children (0-14 years) and an increase in the proportion of adults (15-59 years). This trend is further supported by a declining dependency ratio, suggesting a growing workforce. The proportion of the elderly population (60 years and above) has increased. Regmi said the age between 15 and 24, the most productive time for an individual, is not considered the working age in Nepal, as these people are involved in education and training. “At this age, our survey has found, people will work only if they are offered a job. The responsibility to earn money grows in later years.” The survey data on employment status reveals significant shifts in the labour market between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of those with jobs has declined considerably from 67.2 percent in 1995-96 to 32.4 percent in 2022-23, while the percentage of those not in the labour force has increased from 29.4 percent to 62.9 percent. The share of wage employment in agriculture has significantly declined from 70.7 percent in 1995-96 to 1.9 percent in 2022-23. The share of wage employment in non-agriculture, on the other hand, has risen considerably from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 56.6 percent in 2022-23. The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed. The labour force participation rate came down to 37.1 percent in 2022-23 from 38.2 percent five years ago. “The employment condition in Nepal is the worst,” said economist Pushkar Bajracharya. “The government failed to create jobs. This is because the investment environment has not been favourable in past years, mainly due to political and policy uncertainty. When there is no investment, there is no job creation.” Bajracharya said the unemployment rate would further jump due to the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the recession and slowdown the country has seen. “Many industries, service sectors and companies are still laying off workers due to the economic slowdown. There is low demand for labour in the country as the key economic sectors—construction and manufacturing—are facing recession, while wholesale and retail have shown a slight recovery,” said Bajracharya. The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed. Post File Photo Experts say that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the jobs being created in Nepal’s economy are not of quality. There is a need for new strategies, new partners, and new goals. Each year, around a million Nepali youths, including students, leave the country to try their luck abroad. The survey data on remittances and transfers reveals a significant increase in the prevalence and magnitude of remittances received by households in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of households receiving remittances has increased dramatically from 23.4 percent in 1995-96 to 76.8 percent in 2022-23, indicating a significant rise in the number of Nepali families relying on the money sent by their members working abroad. This increase is consistent with the observed growth in average remittances per household, which has significantly increased from Rs15,160 in 1995-96 to Rs145,093 in 2022-23. Remittances (other than from India) are quite dominant, highlighting the importance of international migration for income generation. Remittances from India declined from 32.9 percent in 1995-96 to 11.1 percent in 2010-11, but they have increased since, reaching 21.3 percent in 2022-23, according to the survey report. The survey data on household loans shows that the percentage of families borrowing money is relatively stable (61.3 percent in 1995-96 and 63.8 percent in 2022-23). However, the percentage of households with outstanding loans has significantly increased, from 58.4 percent in 1995-96 to 97.3 percent in 2022-23. The data also reveals a shift in the sources of household loans. Traditional money lenders were previously a dominant source (39.7 percent in 1995-96), but their share significantly decreased to 11.4 percent in 2022-23. The share of loans from banks has increased (from 16.1 percent in 1995-96 to 22.4 percent in 2022-23), while loans from relatives continue to remain significant (40.8 percent in 1995-96 to 42.5 percent in 2022-23). Household consumption as a reason for borrowing has been declining (from 49.4 percent in 1995-96 to 23.5 percent in 2022-23). This could be attributed to improved access to essential goods and services or a shift to other borrowing needs, the survey report shows. The use of collateral has also shifted, with an increase in the proportion of loans taken with collateral. While 16.8 percent of loans were taken with land and house collateral in 1995-96, this share increased to 35.1 percent in 2022-23. The data shows a noticeable shift in the dominant sectors of non-farm activities. While trade was previously the most prevalent sector (52.1 percent in 1995-96), it has declined (42.5 percent in 2022-23). The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23. Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support. Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72. Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent. According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23. Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867. The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income. The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23. The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population. This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23. The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23. This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23. The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases. There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices. A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices. Cold/fever remains a significant concern, increasing from 43.7 percent in 1995-96 to 51.5 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of those consulting a doctor has remained relatively stable (around 29 percent), and the percentage consulting a paramedic has significantly decreased. Migration patterns within Nepal reveal significant shifts in trends between 2003-04 and 2022-23. While the overall percentage of the migrant population within the country has remained relatively stable—36.6 percent in 2003-04 and 38.1 percent in 2022-23—there is a notable shift in the gender composition of migrants. Males constituted a higher proportion of migrants in 2003-04 (50.1 percent), but females made a larger share of the migrant population (49.6 percent) in 2022-23. A decline in the percentage of migrants from rural areas in 2022-23 indicates a potential shift in migration patterns, possibly driven by changing economic opportunities and societal factors. The analysis of reasons for migration reveals that family remains the dominant factor (75.2 percent in 2003-04 moving within the country for family reasons and 74.9 percent in 2022-23). The fourth Nepal Living Standards Survey, conducted in 2022-23, is the first such survey since the country’s transition to a federal system. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 9,600 households on a wide range of topics.",https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/16/nepal-s-unemployment-rate-rises-to-12-6-percent-survey-says,money

The provincial executives presented budgets two weeks after the federal government unveiled the national budget for the next fiscal year of 2024-25. The local units will shortly present their respective annual budgets as per the legal provisions of the federal set-up. The Koshi provincial government led by CPN-UML leader Hikmat Kumar Karki presented a Rs35.27 billion budget in the provincial assembly. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Ram Bahadur Magar slashed the budget size by around Rs1 million compared with the current fiscal year. The budget has focused on agriculture, physical infrastructure, industry, service sector, education, health and tourism. Karki was also the chief minister when a Rs35.24 billion budget was presented last year in Koshi through ordinance as it was almost certain that the provincial assembly would not pass the policies and programmes as well as the budget. The Karki government was a minority government then. In Madhesh, a total budget of Rs43.89 billion has been presented during the provincial assembly meeting. Finance Minister Bharat Prasad Sah presented the budget for the next fiscal year allocating Rs16.7 billion current expenditure and Rs27.89 billion capital expenditure. The Madhesh government announced that the Nepali year of 2082 BS (2025-26) would be observed as a ‘tourism year’ in the province under the name of ‘Ghumau Madhesh, Bujhau Madhesh’—‘let’s tour and understand the Madhesh’. Meanwhile, the Bagmati province government unveiled a total budget of Rs64.54 billion, which is around Rs2 billion more that the budget of the current fiscal year. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Jagannath Thapaliya presented the budget allocating Rs26.10 billion under current expenditure and Rs36.93 billion under the capital expenditure. The Bagmati government prioritises education, health, agriculture and tourism in the new budget. In Gandaki, a total budget of Rs32.97 billion has been unveiled for the fiscal year 2024-25. The projected budget for the upcoming fiscal year is around Rs450 million less than the current fiscal year’s budget size. Minister for Economic Affairs Takraj Gurung presented the budget at the province assembly meeting by allocating Rs13.16 for recurrent expenditure and Rs19.51 for capital expenditure. The annual budget estimates to collect Rs5.17 through the internal mobilisation of the revenues. The budget projects to receive around Rs7.63 billion under the fiscal equlisation fund, Rs9.61 billion under revenue distribution, Rs481 million under royalty distribution, Rs3.10 billion under the conditional grants, Rs11.9 million matching grant and Rs655.5 million under the special grants from the federal government. While presenting the budget, Minister Gurung said that the provincial government would take around Rs1.70 billion internal loan if required. The Gandaki government also allocates Rs1.16 billion budgets of fiscal transfer to the local units under four different grants. Similarly, the Lumbini government unveiled a Rs38.97 billion budget—28 percent recurrent expenditure, 63 percent capital expenditure and approximately eight percent fiscal transfer—for the next fiscal year. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Chet Narayan Acharya presented the budget at the province assembly meeting, laying focus on reviving an ailing economy. The budget aims to create employment and self-employment opportunities by prioritising the health, education, physical infrastructure, agriculture and tourism sectors. In Karnali, a total budget of Rs31.41 billion has been presented for the next fiscal year, down Rs2 billion from the current fiscal year.

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli once again vented his ire at the budget for the new fiscal year on Saturday, fuelling speculations of growing discord among the ruling parties. On May 29, the day after Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun read out the national budget in Parliament, Oli lambasted some of the provisions and said the fiscal plan was of “one minister and one party”. Oli and his party were unhappy with some of the provisions, including the distribution of funds to the conflict victims, who mostly are CPN (Maoist Centre) members. Oli’s UML is the largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition government. Addressing the UML parliamentary party meeting on Saturday, Oli said the budget had failed to address the concerns of the poor. “Our duty is to stop poverty and lead the country towards development. If the poor are not benefitting and development is not happening, how can we satisfy them?” Oli wondered. He also asked the party’s ministers to see the status of the ministries they lead. “We have to keep track of the budget allocated to the ministries led by the UML,” Oli said, directing the party’s lawmakers to openly discuss the budget in the party and in Parliament. He also accused the government of failing to pay enough attention to development activities. “Our party joined the government to stop poverty and advance development. If that is not happening, how can we be satisfied?” Oli said. Stating that the percentage of the poor had now increased, Oli claimed that poverty had been reduced significantly during his premiership, which lasted over three years until July 2021. A UML central committee leader told the Post that Oli has already expressed his dissatisfaction with the budget with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Oli’s second instance of expressing his displeasure with the budget signals a growing misunderstanding between the two leaders, UML leaders said. Oli wants more spending in the sectors of entrepreneurship and infrastructure. He urged the UML ministers to study the budget but directed the party’s lawmakers not to comment on it on social media platforms. “It’d be better to express your concerns and comments at party meetings,” Oli told UML lawmakers. Also on Saturday, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the opposition Nepali Congress, raised questions about the government’s activities. The UML is in government, but the party is acting as if it is not a part of it, he said. “The UML first sent junior party leaders to the Cabinet. Now it has stopped owning up the government’s activities,” Thapa shared his observation. When the UML goes to people, it takes no responsibility for the government’s works, he said. “They are acting as though the UML was not consulted while the Maoists prepared the budget.” The party had deputed former finance minister Bishnu Poudel to provide inputs and suggestions for the budget.",https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2024/06/16/ruling-party-chief-oli-again-vents-ire-at-budget,province-no-3

Heading not Found,Purushottam Poudel,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"What’s cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party? Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government? Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government. Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises. Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet. After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently. “We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post. Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam. “The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.” After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls. During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said. “However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.” Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K. The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television. “Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.” But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.”",https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2024/06/16/why-are-rsp-leaders-voicing-doubt-about-their-continuity-in-government,province-no-3

Heading not Found,Khushi Das,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"“This is Shesha’s office,” he says as I walk to the dusty aisle with white curtains and purple ink pots. Notes are everywhere, on tissue paper, and signs are on makeup wipes, with Mac wine lipsticks still apparent. Rishi is a man of black and white. His suits are hand-tailored by one of the finest designers in Lalitpur. “Your writing is consistent with Shesha's. I want you to finish her series as a ghostwriter to get your deposit.” The ground beneath me sank when I heard her name for the first time. I knew I was being interviewed for a writing position, but I had no idea I'd be given the chance to wrap up Shesha's series. The series that everyone is waiting for. After the office tour, I asked to see Shesha. Rishi’s smile shrank, and his face tightened. “Shesha hasn’t moved since the accident. There’s very little to no chance that she won’t. Aani looks after her.” Aani is Shesha’s nurse. She bathes her every noon with sterile water and changes her back to white cotton fabric. She sends transparent tubes into her left veins through a sharp silver needle, carefully avoiding the bubbles. Rishi’s house feels like a choir room. The walls here have lips that whisper swiftly as you breathe. The red velvet carpets in the staircase could slip you anytime and crack your skull. The mirrors have secrets that you’d never know, and the pool, well, the pool, is covered with a neon tent and rusty nails. I walk into Shesha’s office, with a walnut-toned wooden floor and scattered notes covering half of it. Her walls are scarlet red with gold wallpaper. She has a typewriter at the edge of her desk, near the window, which hasn’t been touched for a decade. I move the pile of papers to check the typewriter. The papers have been written in a hurry with a red ink pen with purple undertones. It is a pile of notes, a manuscript, that reads, I wore a red dress, burrowed shoes, and a broken watch as I walked into the bar—to find the perfect publisher. I found Rishi there, in a black tie, holding a glass of 600-dollar wine. I might have found my boss’s journal. Right across the door of her office is her bedroom—a dark room with mahogany flooring and only a large window for the light to creep in. Aani wipes her hands and face every morning before she changes her tubes. After drenching myself inside Shesha’s head and probably invading her privacy, I walk to the kitchen. Rishi pours me a glass of wine as I see a picture of Shesha, Rishi, and a little boy I'd never seen. After a whole day of reading about Rishi’s relationship with Shesha, I don't think I have the energy to ask about the little boy with running shoes. Rishi’s eyes immediately tear up as he sips his red wine. His fingers clutch the glass as hard as he can, leaving the hallucinating fingerprints. “My son, who drowned in the pool last summer,” He says. It has been seven weeks since I started staying the night at Rishi’s. We never talked about the son again. I reach for the pile of journals and glance at the last few pages. It reads, “When I got pregnant with Sanu, I felt Rishi loving me more. I noticed him getting home early and loading the pantry with vitamin capsules. He kissed me like he pitied me. Like he only loved me for the baby. After six months, I looked huge. My face puffed up, and my ankles swelled. I was no longer the Shesha he loved. I was the mother of his child, whom he loved. He turned 5 last month. My son is five years old. Or maybe he was. I drowned him today.” My stomach sinks as my heart struggles to escape my chest. I tilt my head toward the window to catch some air. There’s Shesha. Staring at me. In the reflection. Through her bedroom, with her spine erect. I can’t feel my feet, nor my skin, nor the blinding tears in my eyes. I breathe a little when I see Aani holding Shesha’s chin to support her erect spine. After Rishi returns home after work at 8, I run through the red velvet-covered staircase and sprain my ankles. Rishi runs at the same pace to hold me and carry me to the guest room. As he lays me down on the bed with gold Kashmiri sheets, I press my lips against his, tasting Rishi. For this fraction of time, he’s mine. Only mine. Until I saw Shesha standing outside the door—the door that Rishi and I were too busy to lock. “I saw her, Rishi. She can stand. She can walk. She can do more than move her eyes.” Rishi rushes to see Shesha on her bed, still attached to her tubes. I hold Rishi’s hand and take him to her office, despite my bruised ankle. Unsurprisingly, the journals are nowhere to be found. We rush to Shesha’s room again. “I know you can move. I saw you. In the window. Outside the door. Tell Rishi you killed your son.” I spot the journal under her bed and read it out loud to Rishi. Rishi’s rage catches Shesha’s neck. She doesn’t utter a word. Before she says anything, she suffocates to death. I fall on her mahogany brown floor and see a few more papers in the journal. I do not intend to read any more of her journals, but my eyes catch the word “epilogue.” Rishi has gone to get Aani and call the paramedics. I continue reading. “I wrote this to get over my son’s death. To continue writing my series, I thought of introducing a villain into a story. And to get into the villain's mind, I have to practice writing the opposite of how I've always felt. What if I were the villain? How would I feel if I were the evil in my own story? I couldn’t save Sanu, as he was drowning in the pool. What if I am the killer? Maybe I should drive through the tree and kill myself.” I feel dizzy from reading the different plotlines of Shesha’s journals. Why did she behave in a vegetative state if she had wounded herself? Questions swim in my mind as I see another piece of paper with fresh ink. “Rishi found the journals long before you did. Rishi did not read the epilogue. He still thinks that I killed my baby before. That I was too jealous of him for loving the baby more than me. I'm feigning to be in a vegetative state so he won't kill me again. I was going to run tonight. But I saw you kissing him. I rushed to my room to write this epilogue. I rushed to tell you that Rishi crashed my car. Since I'd already written that I would crash my car, Rishi knew what he had to do to make it look like an accident. I pretended to survive the crash and get into a vegetative state so that I could survive. Rishi is my killer.” Twice, I say, as I look at the writer’s body.",https://kathmandupost.com/fiction-park/2024/06/16/the-last-manuscript,fiction-park

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal’s unemployment rate has been increasing, according to a report. The fourth Nepal Living Standard Survey report, published by the National Statistics Office on Thursday, shows that the unemployment rate climbed up to 12.6 percent in 2022-23 from 11.4 percent in 2017-18, representing a 1.2 percent rise in the five-year period. The unemployment rate has risen from 4.9 percent in 1995-96 to 12.6 percent in 2022-23. This rise is more pronounced among younger workers, with the unemployment rate for those aged 15-24 jumping from 7.3 percent in 1995-96 to 22.7 percent in 2022-23. The report said this highlights the challenge of finding jobs for youths in Nepal. The survey report shows joblessness among people between the ages of 15 and 24 declined to 22.7 percent in 2022-23 from 23.9 percent in 2017-18. “Most worrying is the rise in unemployment in the past five years, which increased by 1.2 percent, and that’s worrisome,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the statistics office. “The economy has failed to generate enough jobs for its large and expanding young population.” The population structure has shifted towards a younger working-age population, with a decrease in the proportion of children (0-14 years) and an increase in the proportion of adults (15-59 years). This trend is further supported by a declining dependency ratio, suggesting a growing workforce. The proportion of the elderly population (60 years and above) has increased. Regmi said the age between 15 and 24, the most productive time for an individual, is not considered the working age in Nepal, as these people are involved in education and training. “At this age, our survey has found, people will work only if they are offered a job. The responsibility to earn money grows in later years.” The survey data on employment status reveals significant shifts in the labour market between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of those with jobs has declined considerably from 67.2 percent in 1995-96 to 32.4 percent in 2022-23, while the percentage of those not in the labour force has increased from 29.4 percent to 62.9 percent. The share of wage employment in agriculture has significantly declined from 70.7 percent in 1995-96 to 1.9 percent in 2022-23. The share of wage employment in non-agriculture, on the other hand, has risen considerably from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 56.6 percent in 2022-23. The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed. The labour force participation rate came down to 37.1 percent in 2022-23 from 38.2 percent five years ago. “The employment condition in Nepal is the worst,” said economist Pushkar Bajracharya. “The government failed to create jobs. This is because the investment environment has not been favourable in past years, mainly due to political and policy uncertainty. When there is no investment, there is no job creation.” Bajracharya said the unemployment rate would further jump due to the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the recession and slowdown the country has seen. “Many industries, service sectors and companies are still laying off workers due to the economic slowdown. There is low demand for labour in the country as the key economic sectors—construction and manufacturing—are facing recession, while wholesale and retail have shown a slight recovery,” said Bajracharya. The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed. Post File Photo Experts say that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the jobs being created in Nepal’s economy are not of quality. There is a need for new strategies, new partners, and new goals. Each year, around a million Nepali youths, including students, leave the country to try their luck abroad. The survey data on remittances and transfers reveals a significant increase in the prevalence and magnitude of remittances received by households in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of households receiving remittances has increased dramatically from 23.4 percent in 1995-96 to 76.8 percent in 2022-23, indicating a significant rise in the number of Nepali families relying on the money sent by their members working abroad. This increase is consistent with the observed growth in average remittances per household, which has significantly increased from Rs15,160 in 1995-96 to Rs145,093 in 2022-23. Remittances (other than from India) are quite dominant, highlighting the importance of international migration for income generation. Remittances from India declined from 32.9 percent in 1995-96 to 11.1 percent in 2010-11, but they have increased since, reaching 21.3 percent in 2022-23, according to the survey report. The survey data on household loans shows that the percentage of families borrowing money is relatively stable (61.3 percent in 1995-96 and 63.8 percent in 2022-23). However, the percentage of households with outstanding loans has significantly increased, from 58.4 percent in 1995-96 to 97.3 percent in 2022-23. The data also reveals a shift in the sources of household loans. Traditional money lenders were previously a dominant source (39.7 percent in 1995-96), but their share significantly decreased to 11.4 percent in 2022-23. The share of loans from banks has increased (from 16.1 percent in 1995-96 to 22.4 percent in 2022-23), while loans from relatives continue to remain significant (40.8 percent in 1995-96 to 42.5 percent in 2022-23). Household consumption as a reason for borrowing has been declining (from 49.4 percent in 1995-96 to 23.5 percent in 2022-23). This could be attributed to improved access to essential goods and services or a shift to other borrowing needs, the survey report shows. The use of collateral has also shifted, with an increase in the proportion of loans taken with collateral. While 16.8 percent of loans were taken with land and house collateral in 1995-96, this share increased to 35.1 percent in 2022-23. The data shows a noticeable shift in the dominant sectors of non-farm activities. While trade was previously the most prevalent sector (52.1 percent in 1995-96), it has declined (42.5 percent in 2022-23). The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23. Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support. Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72. Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent. According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23. Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867. The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income. The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23. The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population. This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23. The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23. This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23. The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases. There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices. A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices. Cold/fever remains a significant concern, increasing from 43.7 percent in 1995-96 to 51.5 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of those consulting a doctor has remained relatively stable (around 29 percent), and the percentage consulting a paramedic has significantly decreased. Migration patterns within Nepal reveal significant shifts in trends between 2003-04 and 2022-23. While the overall percentage of the migrant population within the country has remained relatively stable—36.6 percent in 2003-04 and 38.1 percent in 2022-23—there is a notable shift in the gender composition of migrants. Males constituted a higher proportion of migrants in 2003-04 (50.1 percent), but females made a larger share of the migrant population (49.6 percent) in 2022-23. A decline in the percentage of migrants from rural areas in 2022-23 indicates a potential shift in migration patterns, possibly driven by changing economic opportunities and societal factors. The analysis of reasons for migration reveals that family remains the dominant factor (75.2 percent in 2003-04 moving within the country for family reasons and 74.9 percent in 2022-23). The fourth Nepal Living Standards Survey, conducted in 2022-23, is the first such survey since the country’s transition to a federal system. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 9,600 households on a wide range of topics.",https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/16/nepal-s-unemployment-rate-rises-to-12-6-percent-survey-says,money

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal’s unemployment rate has been increasing, according to a report. The fourth Nepal Living Standard Survey report, published by the National Statistics Office on Thursday, shows that the unemployment rate climbed up to 12.6 percent in 2022-23 from 11.4 percent in 2017-18, representing a 1.2 percent rise in the five-year period. The unemployment rate has risen from 4.9 percent in 1995-96 to 12.6 percent in 2022-23. This rise is more pronounced among younger workers, with the unemployment rate for those aged 15-24 jumping from 7.3 percent in 1995-96 to 22.7 percent in 2022-23. The report said this highlights the challenge of finding jobs for youths in Nepal. The survey report shows joblessness among people between the ages of 15 and 24 declined to 22.7 percent in 2022-23 from 23.9 percent in 2017-18. “Most worrying is the rise in unemployment in the past five years, which increased by 1.2 percent, and that’s worrisome,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the statistics office. “The economy has failed to generate enough jobs for its large and expanding young population.” The population structure has shifted towards a younger working-age population, with a decrease in the proportion of children (0-14 years) and an increase in the proportion of adults (15-59 years). This trend is further supported by a declining dependency ratio, suggesting a growing workforce. The proportion of the elderly population (60 years and above) has increased. Regmi said the age between 15 and 24, the most productive time for an individual, is not considered the working age in Nepal, as these people are involved in education and training. “At this age, our survey has found, people will work only if they are offered a job. The responsibility to earn money grows in later years.” The survey data on employment status reveals significant shifts in the labour market between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of those with jobs has declined considerably from 67.2 percent in 1995-96 to 32.4 percent in 2022-23, while the percentage of those not in the labour force has increased from 29.4 percent to 62.9 percent. The share of wage employment in agriculture has significantly declined from 70.7 percent in 1995-96 to 1.9 percent in 2022-23. The share of wage employment in non-agriculture, on the other hand, has risen considerably from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 56.6 percent in 2022-23. The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed. The labour force participation rate came down to 37.1 percent in 2022-23 from 38.2 percent five years ago. “The employment condition in Nepal is the worst,” said economist Pushkar Bajracharya. “The government failed to create jobs. This is because the investment environment has not been favourable in past years, mainly due to political and policy uncertainty. When there is no investment, there is no job creation.” Bajracharya said the unemployment rate would further jump due to the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the recession and slowdown the country has seen. “Many industries, service sectors and companies are still laying off workers due to the economic slowdown. There is low demand for labour in the country as the key economic sectors—construction and manufacturing—are facing recession, while wholesale and retail have shown a slight recovery,” said Bajracharya. The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed. Post File Photo Experts say that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the jobs being created in Nepal’s economy are not of quality. There is a need for new strategies, new partners, and new goals. Each year, around a million Nepali youths, including students, leave the country to try their luck abroad. The survey data on remittances and transfers reveals a significant increase in the prevalence and magnitude of remittances received by households in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of households receiving remittances has increased dramatically from 23.4 percent in 1995-96 to 76.8 percent in 2022-23, indicating a significant rise in the number of Nepali families relying on the money sent by their members working abroad. This increase is consistent with the observed growth in average remittances per household, which has significantly increased from Rs15,160 in 1995-96 to Rs145,093 in 2022-23. Remittances (other than from India) are quite dominant, highlighting the importance of international migration for income generation. Remittances from India declined from 32.9 percent in 1995-96 to 11.1 percent in 2010-11, but they have increased since, reaching 21.3 percent in 2022-23, according to the survey report. The survey data on household loans shows that the percentage of families borrowing money is relatively stable (61.3 percent in 1995-96 and 63.8 percent in 2022-23). However, the percentage of households with outstanding loans has significantly increased, from 58.4 percent in 1995-96 to 97.3 percent in 2022-23. The data also reveals a shift in the sources of household loans. Traditional money lenders were previously a dominant source (39.7 percent in 1995-96), but their share significantly decreased to 11.4 percent in 2022-23. The share of loans from banks has increased (from 16.1 percent in 1995-96 to 22.4 percent in 2022-23), while loans from relatives continue to remain significant (40.8 percent in 1995-96 to 42.5 percent in 2022-23). Household consumption as a reason for borrowing has been declining (from 49.4 percent in 1995-96 to 23.5 percent in 2022-23). This could be attributed to improved access to essential goods and services or a shift to other borrowing needs, the survey report shows. The use of collateral has also shifted, with an increase in the proportion of loans taken with collateral. While 16.8 percent of loans were taken with land and house collateral in 1995-96, this share increased to 35.1 percent in 2022-23. The data shows a noticeable shift in the dominant sectors of non-farm activities. While trade was previously the most prevalent sector (52.1 percent in 1995-96), it has declined (42.5 percent in 2022-23). The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23. Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support. Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72. Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent. According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23. Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867. The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income. The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23. The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population. This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23. The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23. This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23. The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases. There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices. A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices. Cold/fever remains a significant concern, increasing from 43.7 percent in 1995-96 to 51.5 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of those consulting a doctor has remained relatively stable (around 29 percent), and the percentage consulting a paramedic has significantly decreased. Migration patterns within Nepal reveal significant shifts in trends between 2003-04 and 2022-23. While the overall percentage of the migrant population within the country has remained relatively stable—36.6 percent in 2003-04 and 38.1 percent in 2022-23—there is a notable shift in the gender composition of migrants. Males constituted a higher proportion of migrants in 2003-04 (50.1 percent), but females made a larger share of the migrant population (49.6 percent) in 2022-23. A decline in the percentage of migrants from rural areas in 2022-23 indicates a potential shift in migration patterns, possibly driven by changing economic opportunities and societal factors. The analysis of reasons for migration reveals that family remains the dominant factor (75.2 percent in 2003-04 moving within the country for family reasons and 74.9 percent in 2022-23). The fourth Nepal Living Standards Survey, conducted in 2022-23, is the first such survey since the country’s transition to a federal system. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 9,600 households on a wide range of topics.",https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/16/nepal-s-unemployment-rate-rises-to-12-6-percent-survey-says,money

Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government? Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government. Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises. Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet. After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently. “We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post. Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam. “The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.” After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls. During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said. “However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.” Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K. The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television. “Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.” But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.”",https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2024/06/16/why-are-rsp-leaders-voicing-doubt-about-their-continuity-in-government,province-no-3

Heading not Found,Post District Bureau,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"All seven provinces on Saturday unveiled their annual budgets for the upcoming fiscal year of 2024-25 beginning mid-July, mainly prioritising developing physical infrastructures, enhancing agricultural production and expanding the social safety net. The provincial executives presented budgets two weeks after the federal government unveiled the national budget for the next fiscal year of 2024-25. The local units will shortly present their respective annual budgets as per the legal provisions of the federal set-up. The Koshi provincial government led by CPN-UML leader Hikmat Kumar Karki presented a Rs35.27 billion budget in the provincial assembly. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Ram Bahadur Magar slashed the budget size by around Rs1 million compared with the current fiscal year. The budget has focused on agriculture, physical infrastructure, industry, service sector, education, health and tourism. Karki was also the chief minister when a Rs35.24 billion budget was presented last year in Koshi through ordinance as it was almost certain that the provincial assembly would not pass the policies and programmes as well as the budget. The Karki government was a minority government then. In Madhesh, a total budget of Rs43.89 billion has been presented during the provincial assembly meeting. Finance Minister Bharat Prasad Sah presented the budget for the next fiscal year allocating Rs16.7 billion current expenditure and Rs27.89 billion capital expenditure. The Madhesh government announced that the Nepali year of 2082 BS (2025-26) would be observed as a ‘tourism year’ in the province under the name of ‘Ghumau Madhesh, Bujhau Madhesh’—‘let’s tour and understand the Madhesh’. Meanwhile, the Bagmati province government unveiled a total budget of Rs64.54 billion, which is around Rs2 billion more that the budget of the current fiscal year. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Jagannath Thapaliya presented the budget allocating Rs26.10 billion under current expenditure and Rs36.93 billion under the capital expenditure. The Bagmati government prioritises education, health, agriculture and tourism in the new budget. In Gandaki, a total budget of Rs32.97 billion has been unveiled for the fiscal year 2024-25. The projected budget for the upcoming fiscal year is around Rs450 million less than the current fiscal year’s budget size. Minister for Economic Affairs Takraj Gurung presented the budget at the province assembly meeting by allocating Rs13.16 for recurrent expenditure and Rs19.51 for capital expenditure. The annual budget estimates to collect Rs5.17 through the internal mobilisation of the revenues.

Heading not Found,Post District Bureau,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"All seven provinces on Saturday unveiled their annual budgets for the upcoming fiscal year of 2024-25 beginning mid-July, mainly prioritising developing physical infrastructures, enhancing agricultural production and expanding the social safety net. The provincial executives presented budgets two weeks after the federal government unveiled the national budget for the next fiscal year of 2024-25. The local units will shortly present their respective annual budgets as per the legal provisions of the federal set-up. The Koshi provincial government led by CPN-UML leader Hikmat Kumar Karki presented a Rs35.27 billion budget in the provincial assembly. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Ram Bahadur Magar slashed the budget size by around Rs1 million compared with the current fiscal year. The budget has focused on agriculture, physical infrastructure, industry, service sector, education, health and tourism. Karki was also the chief minister when a Rs35.24 billion budget was presented last year in Koshi through ordinance as it was almost certain that the provincial assembly would not pass the policies and programmes as well as the budget. The Karki government was a minority government then. In Madhesh, a total budget of Rs43.89 billion has been presented during the provincial assembly meeting. Finance Minister Bharat Prasad Sah presented the budget for the next fiscal year allocating Rs16.7 billion current expenditure and Rs27.89 billion capital expenditure. The Madhesh government announced that the Nepali year of 2082 BS (2025-26) would be observed as a ‘tourism year’ in the province under the name of ‘Ghumau Madhesh, Bujhau Madhesh’—‘let’s tour and understand the Madhesh’. Meanwhile, the Bagmati province government unveiled a total budget of Rs64.54 billion, which is around Rs2 billion more that the budget of the current fiscal year. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Jagannath Thapaliya presented the budget allocating Rs26.10 billion under current expenditure and Rs36.93 billion under the capital expenditure. The Bagmati government prioritises education, health, agriculture and tourism in the new budget. In Gandaki, a total budget of Rs32.97 billion has been unveiled for the fiscal year 2024-25. The projected budget for the upcoming fiscal year is around Rs450 million less than the current fiscal year’s budget size. Minister for Economic Affairs Takraj Gurung presented the budget at the province assembly meeting by allocating Rs13.16 for recurrent expenditure and Rs19.51 for capital expenditure. The annual budget estimates to collect Rs5.17 through the internal mobilisation of the revenues. The budget projects to receive around Rs7.63 billion under the fiscal equlisation fund, Rs9.61 billion under revenue distribution, Rs481 million under royalty distribution, Rs3.10 billion under the conditional grants, Rs11.9 million matching grant and Rs655.5 million under the special grants from the federal government.

Their warning comes as the government plans to endorse the national budget on Thursday. The staff at the Parliament Secretariat claim that they have to work regularly before and after office hours without being paid a penny beyond their regular salary. “It has been three years since the government stopped paying the allowance,” Govind Belbase, chairperson of the Employee Union of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, told the Post. “We had to resort to protest as no money has been allocated in the budget for the upcoming fiscal year as well.” The national budget was tabled in Parliament on May 28, and the ministry-wise discussions are currently ongoing. The budget for the fiscal year 2024-2025 is scheduled to be endorsed on Thursday. Belbase said that the House meetings, which generally start at 11 am, run beyond 5 pm regularly. The staff must arrive at least an hour before the meeting for preparations and stay an additional hour after the meeting. House committee meetings are held at around 8 am, before Parliament meetings. “It is common for us to work 10-12 hours a day without any allowance,” Belbase said. He said it was injustice to them and against the ILO Convention of 1930, to which Nepal is a party. Article 3 of the Convention states, “The hours of work of persons to whom this Convention applies shall not exceed forty-eight hours in the week and eight hours in the day, except as hereinafter otherwise provided.” The allowance for government staff was withdrawn following the Covid-19 pandemic. The government resumed the allowance in some state agencies, including the Election Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, but not in Parliament, said Belbase. “If there is no assurance of additional allowance, we won’t work beyond office hours,” he said. It is not possible to manage the House committee meetings and the parliamentary proceedings within office hours. The united staff worked on Friday wearing black armbands in a symbolic protest. They announced their plan to stage a sit-in in front of the Office of the Federal Parliament General Secretary for an hour starting Sunday. If their demands are not addressed, they will not work before and after office hours, the union leader said. Even before the budget was tabled, Speaker Devraj Ghimire had requested Barsha Man Pun, the finance minister, to increase Parliament’s budget and resume the allowances for extra work. However, the money hasn’t been allocated in the new budget.",https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2024/06/16/parliament-staff-begin-protest-as-budget-discussion-continues,province-no-3

Heading not Found,Dil Kumar Ale Magar,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"With a bit of luck Nepal’s fairytale victory would have been secured. The country’s hopes of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup ended after they lost to cricketing powerhouse South Africa by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller in their Group D match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent on Saturday. But their spirited performance earned praise worldwide after almost pulling off an upset win over one of the tournament favourites. Fielding first after winning the toss, the Rhinos restricted a strong Proteas team to a subpar 115-7 with their stupendous spin attack as Dipendra Singh Airee and part-time bowler Kushal Bhurtel shared all seven wickets that fell between them on a turning track. But they fell agonisingly short from recording their historic first ever victory over an ICC’s full-member nation after they could only manage 114-7. Despite the heartbreak, Nepal’s performance caught attention worldwide. “A performance to be proud of. Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter. South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show. “It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.” Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them. “Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.” Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!” “Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?” ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.” At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player. After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result. “We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.” He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].” Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage. Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries. But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase. Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game. Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings. Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand. After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs. But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls. Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat. Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls. Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Sompal Kami consoles Gulsan Jha (right) after Nepal lost their T20 World Cup Group D match against South Africa in Kingstown on Saturday. Hemanta Shrestha/TKP Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target. Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts. Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end. Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings. South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over. Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket. South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control. Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next. South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings. Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls. Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell. “I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said. South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling. “First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said. The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets. South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches. Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note. Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round. The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group.",https://kathmandupost.com/cricket/2024/06/16/nepal-lose-to-south-africa-win-over-the-world,cricket

After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs. But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls. Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat. Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls. Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Sompal Kami consoles Gulsan Jha (right) after Nepal lost their T20 World Cup Group D match against South Africa in Kingstown on Saturday. Hemanta Shrestha/TKP Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target. Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts. Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end. Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings. South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over. Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket. South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control. Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next. South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings. Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls. Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell. “I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said. South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling. “First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said. The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets. South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches. Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note. Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round. The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group.",https://kathmandupost.com/cricket/2024/06/16/nepal-lose-to-south-africa-win-over-the-world,cricket

Heading not Found,Mukesh Dangol & Shreejana Bhusal,"June 14, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"“Our land. Our future”. The theme for this year’s World Environment Day, emphasising land restoration, combating desertification and building resilience to drought, encompasses the pressing issues of this era which need careful intervention. The scale and intensity of the impacts of land degradation, desertification and drought are alarming. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) states that up to 40 percent of the world’s land is degraded, adversely impacting around 3.2 billion people. Projections also indicate that over three-quarters of the world's population by 2050 will be affected by drought. These impacts manifest in several aspects of life and nature, including loss of biodiversity and ecosystems, depletion of resources, food insecurity, livelihood and ultimate human existence. In recent times, land degradation induced by physical, chemical and biological processes has been accelerated by human activities. The main culprits include haphazard infrastructure development, industrialisation, high carbon-intensive energy use, overgrazing and excessive extraction of natural resources without consideration of environmental sustainability. Prolonged droughts are becoming more common and climate change adds uncertainty and complexities to their occurrences. Nepal’s vulnerability Nepal’s young mountains are geologically fragile and complex. Located in a tectonically active zone, the whole land mass from the Himalayas in the North to the Siwalik in the South is susceptible to peculiar challenges, especially erosion, landslides and floods. Anthropogenic activities in this hazard-prone region, including haphazard infrastructure construction, land use change, and chemical fertiliser and pesticide overuse, exacerbate these natural phenomena. For instance, road construction on the slopes without due consideration to the environment and slope stabilisation in the last decade has increased incidents of landslides and slope failures. Excessive extraction of resources from rivers is another concern. While regulatory provisions in the Environment Protection Act and Regulation mandate comprehensive assessment, project developers often perceive such provisions as a burden. Limited focus on the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan, compliance monitoring and evaluation, and audits are the reasons behind haphazard resource extraction and the continuation of environmentally unsustainable projects. Soil loss through erosion, a serious threat to soil health, results in agricultural yield decline, ecosystem degradation, habitat destruction and several economic impacts. A 2016 study by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) estimated 40 million tons of soil loss between 1990 and 2010 in the Koshi basin. Identification of arable soil loss areas is critical for effective land management planning focused on conservation measures. The 61st report of the Office of the Auditor General pointed out that the content of soil organic matter currently stands at 2.83 against the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 3.37. Policy interventions A 2018 report titled “Land degradation neutrality target setting program in Nepal” set three targets to be achieved by 2030: i) Increase forest cover to 44.7 percent; ii) increase agricultural growth by 6 percent; iii) increase Soil Organic Carbon in forest and cropland by 1 percent per annum and iv) restoring 10 percent of wetland ecosystem out of 26277 sq. hectares of wetlands. Among these, Nepal’s success in increasing forest cover from 39.6 percent in 1993 to 44.74 percent in 2018 is praised all over the world as one of the best-case examples of sustainable forest management initiatives. Despite this achievement, the recent episodes of forest fires during the pre-monsoon period are worrisome. The attainment of other targets requires concentrated effort by building synergies and collaboration among national policies/strategies and different climate action programmes. For instance, Land Use Policy, Agriculture Development Strategy, Nepal Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and Climate Change Policy are required to be aligned on its objectives, strategies and programmes. At the programme level, for instance, the National Climate Change Support Programme, the National Adaptation Plan, and the President Chure Terai Madesh Conservation Programme need to focus on a collaborative approach; eliminating duplication and creating synergies among beneficiaries and outcome of this programme. Research on drought shows an increasing trend in both the intensity and frequency of drought occurrences. The impacts of drought are significantly higher in rain-fed agricultural regions like Nepal, which rely extensively on the monsoon. Droughts result in crop failures and food insecurity, which is why region-specific explorations of droughts are essential for effective drought monitoring and risk mitigation. A 2021 study indicated that summer drought events have increased fivefold in the central region, doubled in the eastern region, and not significantly changed in the western region of Nepal. These incidences have severe implications for vulnerable communities that are mostly dependent on subsentence agriculture for their livelihood. As a result, difficulty in local livelihoods prevails, which acts as a “push factor” leading to increased migration from rural to urban city centres and abroad. Soil health Healthy soil is the foundation not only of agricultural systems and food security but also of the existence of humans. So, data management should be a priority towards understanding and analysing the pattern, trend and hotspots of land degradation and droughts. Sustainable land management programmes should incorporate soil conservation and watershed management, soil fertility management and improvement, community forestry programmes, technology development, and research and development. Climate-smart agriculture and the implementation and monitoring of environmental management plans are equally important. For these programmes to be successful, functional coordination mechanisms and institutional arrangements are pivotal. Further, opportunities to tap climate finance for implementing adaptation programmes at the local level will be crucial. But the state alone cannot address the land degradation problem; rather, collaboration among all sectors and stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, and the general public, is essential for achieving the desired outcomes in restoring land, combating desertification and building drought resilience.",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/14/drought-land-and-livelihood,columns

Heading not Found,Arooj Waheed Dar,"June 14, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Even in 2024, women stand a long way from accessing equal opportunities with men. The persistent gender disparities across various spheres of life—education, employment, healthcare, and beyond—are stark reminders of the structural barriers confronting women in Pakistan. Despite efforts, the nation consistently lags on gender parity indices, raising concerns about the adequacy and sufficiency of initiatives targeted at closing the gender gap. Placed 142nd out of 146 countries on the WEF’s 2023 Global Gender Gap Index, it is evident that significant strides are needed to address gender inequities in Pakistan. An examination of past budgetary allocations and policy documents unveils a persistent neglect of gender considerations, manifesting in inadequate resource allocation for women across crucial sectors. These systemic imbalances perpetuate gender inequalities, thwarting the full realisation of Pakistan’s human potential. Recent stabilisation policies have further tilted the scales against women due to discriminate access to formal capital markets, decent jobs, financial and digital tools, etc. As the new fiscal year approaches, it is imperative to remind the government of the gender issues that have only received perfunctory attention over the years. Policymakers must acknowledge that no economic recovery can be sustainable if half the country’s population is inhibited in its capacity to contribute productively, underscoring the need for gender-centric policies. While economic revival must remain a top priority, any effort towards this goal without adequate female representation is like building a house of cards. Sustainable economic recovery is contingent upon the mainstreaming of gender-centric policies across all sectors. This necessitates integrating the gendered impacts of policies into the planning process, rather than treating them as an afterthought. In this context, the federal and provincial budgets can be leveraged by respective governments to address disparities through gender-responsive budgeting. Gender Responsive Budget entails evaluating the gendered impacts of budgetary allocations, integrating gender equality in planning processes, and establishing monitoring mechanisms for greater accountability. The overarching goal is to ensure equitable distribution of resources for inclusive development. It is disconcerting that despite the widespread adoption of Gender Responsive Budget in many countries, including South Asian counterparts India and Bangladesh, Pakistan has yet to present a gender-responsive budget. As a first step, all PC-1 forms must incorporate a dedicated section obligating departments to thoroughly assess the gendered impacts of the proposed projects. Projects that help level the playing field should be prioritised over those that magnify distortions. Additionally, macroeconomic policies must only be implemented after carefully assessing their differential impacts on women. To further promote gender equity, several key demands must be addressed, including ensuring equal employment opportunities, pay equity, supporting women-owned businesses with financial incentives, and increasing funding for girls’ education, especially in underserved areas. Expanding maternal, reproductive, and mental health services, establishing affordable childcare facilities, and streng­thening laws and support services against gender-based violence are also essential, particularly in the face of climatic cha­l­lenges. Ad­­diti­o­­nally, enhancing social protection program­mes for more coverage, along with increasing digital and financial access is essential to promote equity. Greater representation of women in decision-making roles is of utmost import­ance. Currently, political representation seems confined to a few privileged women, often detached from the everyday challenges faced by the majority. This lack of representative female voices in the political arena results in the formation of ineffective policies that overlook critical gender issues. Developing mechanisms to facilitate participatory budgeting can help address this concern. The government must also prioritise data consolidation to support evidence-based policymaking. At present, the inadequate targeting of social programmes stemming from deficiencies in data undermines the effectiveness of initiatives. With limited fiscal space, the government must calibrate each and every budgetary allocation judiciously for maximised impact, for which data is key. In a nutshell, mainstreaming gender considerations across all sectors during the planning phase can enable policy-makers to significantly enhance the prospects for fairer, more inclusive economic resurgence. -Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/14/thinking-pink,columns

Heading not Found,Jagadish Prasad Bist,"June 14, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal is in the hands of shortsighted and irrational decision-makers. Take, for example, the recent directive by Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to deploy traffic rule violators for traffic management. Thankfully, Lamichhane’s directive was overturned by the Supreme Court. The Kathmandu Road Division’s hasty decision to blacktop the road section the Kathmandu Metropolitan City had prepared for footpath extension is another example. It is striking how Lamichhane—a journalist-turned-politician and a former vocal critic of the ministers from parties he now aligns with—turned out no different. He is just as unscrupulous and power-hungry as the old guard, doing everything he can to remain in power and satisfy his political ambitions. Such a hunger for power leads him to make hasty and moody decisions, further augmenting the burden on the economy and society. This piece will analyse the economic cost of such decisions later, but first, let’s understand the reasons behind the pomposity of the leaders. One must understand political schooling to understand why Nepali politicians, new and old, formulate bizarre policies. What are the qualifications to become a politician, let alone a minister, in Nepal? It is anything but education and expertise. The current federal Cabinet of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and state and local level governments are not far from any of this. Most of them are no experts, nor do they hold the required knowledge to run their positions. The irony is that we have a government where a journalist becomes the home minister, a former rebel commander becomes the finance minister, and someone who lost the election becomes the minister of foreign affairs, home affairs, and physical infrastructure and transportation, all within a year under the same prime ministership. How can one person seamlessly transition between ministries overnight and suddenly become an expert in each field? Consequences The lack of proper education and thorough understanding of the policymakers’ responsibilities is causing serious problems at the policy level. This is the main reason for their narrow-mindedness—their inability to accept diversity and expert opinions—and to understand complex social and economic phenomena, which leads them to have a “holier-than-thou” and “I am the law” attitude. Huge economic costs and unnecessary social burdens come with that. Every economic policy comes with economic and social costs. Economic costs are of two types: Direct costs and opportunity costs. Direct costs are the actual tangible expenditures associated with implementing a policy and can be easily measured. Opportunity costs are implicit and come with forgone policy alternatives. These are difficult to measure, yet are crucial for policy evaluation, as they directly affect overall output or the economy. For example, had the home minister's recent ruling not been halted by the Supreme Court, it would have cost the nation an estimated Rs250 million a year. This calculation is based on the daily productivity of an individual ($1434/365) at the current exchange rate ( Rs133.25/USD ) and 1,300 incidences per day. The recent impulsive decision by the Road Department, under Raghuvir Mahaseth, to blacktop a section of the New Road, led to financial costs. If the minister were concerned about the people and the economy, he would have worked to speed up the construction of the remaining section of the Ring Road, which has far more important economic, social, and health and environmental concerns. As a result of these difficulties, households are bearing extra social costs, and the retail and service economies are losing productivity in the area due to a lack of proper infrastructure and environmental quality. Further, this will only increase the cost of production over time and reduce the country’s output because of fewer economic activities. Similarly, the former finance minister Janardan Sharma’s controversial tax policy and the current finance minister Barsha Man Pun's ineffective policy of distributing the budget for their cadres through popular programmes such as the Prime Minister Daughter Resilient Programme—when similar programmes like former PM KP Oli’s Prime Minister Employment Programme turned into white elephants—will add further burden. The inconsistency in the government’s policies, such as reducing tax last year and increasing this year on electric vehicles, shows a lack of understanding of the matter. These are just a few examples of irrational and farfetched laws and policies of the past and incumbent governments. The politicians’ behaviours and self-righteous actions put a huge economic, social and environmental toll on the nation. Additionally, policies that lead to the depletion of natural resources and allocation of public property to private politicians’ cronies result from the irresponsibility of the leaders. Not to forget, the decisions of the former government led by KP Oli to allow the commercialisation and export of natural resources from the Chure region and swap the land of the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate are no less concerning. There should be stringent mechanisms to control politicians’ reckless decisions. Though the Supreme Court has been overturning such steps, self-fulfilling politicians like those in the current and past governments remain a nuisance. Politicians must be made responsible for their deeds, even if they do not trigger corruption cases. Publicising cost-benefit analysis before formulating any such policies and regulations should be made mandatory. Otherwise, no matter whether the old or the new leaders make it to the government with their chicaneries, Nepal will continue to bear economic, social and environmental costs.",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/14/the-costs-of-leaders-irrational-decisions,columns

Heading not Found,Author not Found,"June 13, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"In what looks like a perfect example of a circle of financial gain and loss, Nepal is sending a significant amount of money, much of which is earned through remittance, to foreign destinations every year to pay for the higher education of Nepalis. In the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023-24, which began in mid-July, the country sent out 95.85 billion rupees in foreign education alone. The figure could be even higher, as students and their guardians often find non-conventional or illegal mediums, including hundi, to transfer money abroad. What is alarming is that the official figures represent a 42.5 percent increase from the same duration in the last fiscal year, when students took Rs67.19 billion to spend on education abroad. In FY 2022-23, the total outgoing amount stood at Rs142 billion, a 48 percent rise from the Rs67.70 billion in FY 2021-22. Along with cash, the number of Nepali youths leaving home for education abroad is growing each year. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, over 90,000 students have obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Education. The total figure for FY 2022-23 stood at over 110,000, while it was almost 113,000 in FY 2021-22. As per the Ministry of Education, the number of students obtaining NOC has tripled in the past decade. That these students start earning after a few years and send money is a positive fact not to be missed—Nepal’s remittance is growing every year, thanks to the students-turned-non-resident Nepalis and labour migrants. But what we gain from remittance, we end up losing in the form of human capital. At a median age of 27.1, we are still a relatively younger country, which makes us a lucrative source for the export of youths. Our youths are heading out of the country in hundreds of thousands each year, and the risk is that they might return to the country only when we have missed the train of development. It is no surprise that 33 percent of the NOCs are obtained for study in Japan, a country of old people with a median age of almost 50 years. Ageing or aged developed countries like Japan, the United States and Canada, among many others, need a constant supply of youth migrants willing to toil hard. Poor countries of Asia and Africa have become rich sources for the export of cheap labour that not only sustains the economies of developed countries but also supplies children who transform from immigrants to naturalised citizens and keep those countries in rude demographic health. Meanwhile, those in positions of power in Nepal, including political leaders, bureaucrats and university and school authorities, continue to turn the country into an undesirable place. As education becomes expensive and the job market is saturated, youths see no reason to stay back in Nepal. While education abroad is no guarantee of success, we have collectively failed to assure students of the quality of education we are offering at home. Apart from improving the quality itself, we also need to work on image-building—that Nepal’s education is not as bad as it has been made out to be.",https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/13/exodus-of-human-capital,editorial

Their warning comes as the government plans to endorse the national budget on Thursday. The staff at the Parliament Secretariat claim that they have to work regularly before and after office hours without being paid a penny beyond their regular salary. “It has been three years since the government stopped paying the allowance,” Govind Belbase, chairperson of the Employee Union of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, told the Post. “We had to resort to protest as no money has been allocated in the budget for the upcoming fiscal year as well.” The national budget was tabled in Parliament on May 28, and the ministry-wise discussions are currently ongoing. The budget for the fiscal year 2024-2025 is scheduled to be endorsed on Thursday. Belbase said that the House meetings, which generally start at 11 am, run beyond 5 pm regularly. The staff must arrive at least an hour before the meeting for preparations and stay an additional hour after the meeting. House committee meetings are held at around 8 am, before Parliament meetings. “It is common for us to work 10-12 hours a day without any allowance,” Belbase said. He said it was injustice to them and against the ILO Convention of 1930, to which Nepal is a party. Article 3 of the Convention states, “The hours of work of persons to whom this Convention applies shall not exceed forty-eight hours in the week and eight hours in the day, except as hereinafter otherwise provided.” The allowance for government staff was withdrawn following the Covid-19 pandemic. The government resumed the allowance in some state agencies, including the Election Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, but not in Parliament, said Belbase. “If there is no assurance of additional allowance, we won’t work beyond office hours,” he said. It is not possible to manage the House committee meetings and the parliamentary proceedings within office hours. The united staff worked on Friday wearing black armbands in a symbolic protest. They announced their plan to stage a sit-in in front of the Office of the Federal Parliament General Secretary for an hour starting Sunday. If their demands are not addressed, they will not work before and after office hours, the union leader said.

Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government? Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government. Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises. Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet. After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently. “We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post. Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam. “The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.” After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls. During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said. “However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.” Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K. The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television. “Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.” But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.”",https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2024/06/16/why-are-rsp-leaders-voicing-doubt-about-their-continuity-in-government,province-no-3

On May 29, the day after Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun read out the national budget in Parliament, Oli lambasted some of the provisions and said the fiscal plan was of “one minister and one party”. Oli and his party were unhappy with some of the provisions, including the distribution of funds to the conflict victims, who mostly are CPN (Maoist Centre) members. Oli’s UML is the largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition government. Addressing the UML parliamentary party meeting on Saturday, Oli said the budget had failed to address the concerns of the poor. “Our duty is to stop poverty and lead the country towards development.

He also asked the party’s ministers to see the status of the ministries they lead. “We have to keep track of the budget allocated to the ministries led by the UML,” Oli said, directing the party’s lawmakers to openly discuss the budget in the party and in Parliament. He also accused the government of failing to pay enough attention to development activities. “Our party joined the government to stop poverty and advance development.

According to the locals, the incessant rainfall has posed a serious threat to the residents of Sirijangha Rural Municipality-6 and Yamphudin village settlement. “Except for Bhotegaun, no other place in ward 8 is safe,” said Krishna Gurung, the chairperson of the ward. “Rain has affected everything. We have asked the locals to identify and find shelter in safe places.” Over a dozen homes across the district have been considered at high risk, as landslides, occurring from both back and front of the houses, have sandwiched most buildings.

The provincial executives presented budgets two weeks after the federal government unveiled the national budget for the next fiscal year of 2024-25. The local units will shortly present their respective annual budgets as per the legal provisions of the federal set-up. The Koshi provincial government led by CPN-UML leader Hikmat Kumar Karki presented a Rs35.27 billion budget in the provincial assembly. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Ram Bahadur Magar slashed the budget size by around Rs1 million compared with the current fiscal year. The budget has focused on agriculture, physical infrastructure, industry, service sector, education, health and tourism.

The Karki government was a minority government then. In Madhesh, a total budget of Rs43.89 billion has been presented during the provincial assembly meeting. Finance Minister Bharat Prasad Sah presented the budget for the next fiscal year allocating Rs16.7 billion current expenditure and Rs27.89 billion capital expenditure. The Madhesh government announced that the Nepali year of 2082 BS (2025-26) would be observed as a ‘tourism year’ in the province under the name of ‘Ghumau Madhesh, Bujhau Madhesh’—‘let’s tour and understand the Madhesh’.

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal’s unemployment rate has been increasing, according to a report. The fourth Nepal Living Standard Survey report, published by the National Statistics Office on Thursday, shows that the unemployment rate climbed up to 12.6 percent in 2022-23 from 11.4 percent in 2017-18, representing a 1.2 percent rise in the five-year period. The unemployment rate has risen from 4.9 percent in 1995-96 to 12.6 percent in 2022-23. This rise is more pronounced among younger workers, with the unemployment rate for those aged 15-24 jumping from 7.3 percent in 1995-96 to 22.7 percent in 2022-23. The report said this highlights the challenge of finding jobs for youths in Nepal. The survey report shows joblessness among people between the ages of 15 and 24 declined to 22.7 percent in 2022-23 from 23.9 percent in 2017-18. “Most worrying is the rise in unemployment in the past five years, which increased by 1.2 percent, and that’s worrisome,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the statistics office. “The economy has failed to generate enough jobs for its large and expanding young population.” The population structure has shifted towards a younger working-age population, with a decrease in the proportion of children (0-14 years) and an increase in the proportion of adults (15-59 years). This trend is further supported by a declining dependency ratio, suggesting a growing workforce. The proportion of the elderly population (60 years and above) has increased. Regmi said the age between 15 and 24, the most productive time for an individual, is not considered the working age in Nepal, as these people are involved in education and training. “At this age, our survey has found, people will work only if they are offered a job. The responsibility to earn money grows in later years.” The survey data on employment status reveals significant shifts in the labour market between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of those with jobs has declined considerably from 67.2 percent in 1995-96 to 32.4 percent in 2022-23, while the percentage of those not in the labour force has increased from 29.4 percent to 62.9 percent. The share of wage employment in agriculture has significantly declined from 70.7 percent in 1995-96 to 1.9 percent in 2022-23. The share of wage employment in non-agriculture, on the other hand, has risen considerably from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 56.6 percent in 2022-23. The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed. The labour force participation rate came down to 37.1 percent in 2022-23 from 38.2 percent five years ago. “The employment condition in Nepal is the worst,” said economist Pushkar Bajracharya. “The government failed to create jobs. This is because the investment environment has not been favourable in past years, mainly due to political and policy uncertainty. When there is no investment, there is no job creation.” Bajracharya said the unemployment rate would further jump due to the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the recession and slowdown the country has seen. “Many industries, service sectors and companies are still laying off workers due to the economic slowdown. There is low demand for labour in the country as the key economic sectors—construction and manufacturing—are facing recession, while wholesale and retail have shown a slight recovery,” said Bajracharya. The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed. Post File Photo Experts say that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the jobs being created in Nepal’s economy are not of quality. There is a need for new strategies, new partners, and new goals. Each year, around a million Nepali youths, including students, leave the country to try their luck abroad. The survey data on remittances and transfers reveals a significant increase in the prevalence and magnitude of remittances received by households in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of households receiving remittances has increased dramatically from 23.4 percent in 1995-96 to 76.8 percent in 2022-23, indicating a significant rise in the number of Nepali families relying on the money sent by their members working abroad. This increase is consistent with the observed growth in average remittances per household, which has significantly increased from Rs15,160 in 1995-96 to Rs145,093 in 2022-23. Remittances (other than from India) are quite dominant, highlighting the importance of international migration for income generation. Remittances from India declined from 32.9 percent in 1995-96 to 11.1 percent in 2010-11, but they have increased since, reaching 21.3 percent in 2022-23, according to the survey report. The survey data on household loans shows that the percentage of families borrowing money is relatively stable (61.3 percent in 1995-96 and 63.8 percent in 2022-23). However, the percentage of households with outstanding loans has significantly increased, from 58.4 percent in 1995-96 to 97.3 percent in 2022-23. The data also reveals a shift in the sources of household loans. Traditional money lenders were previously a dominant source (39.7 percent in 1995-96), but their share significantly decreased to 11.4 percent in 2022-23. The share of loans from banks has increased (from 16.1 percent in 1995-96 to 22.4 percent in 2022-23), while loans from relatives continue to remain significant (40.8 percent in 1995-96 to 42.5 percent in 2022-23). Household consumption as a reason for borrowing has been declining (from 49.4 percent in 1995-96 to 23.5 percent in 2022-23). This could be attributed to improved access to essential goods and services or a shift to other borrowing needs, the survey report shows. The use of collateral has also shifted, with an increase in the proportion of loans taken with collateral. While 16.8 percent of loans were taken with land and house collateral in 1995-96, this share increased to 35.1 percent in 2022-23. The data shows a noticeable shift in the dominant sectors of non-farm activities. While trade was previously the most prevalent sector (52.1 percent in 1995-96), it has declined (42.5 percent in 2022-23). The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23. Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support. Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72. Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent. According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23. Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867. The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income. The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23. The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population. This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23. The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23. This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23. The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases. There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices. A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices. Cold/fever remains a significant concern, increasing from 43.7 percent in 1995-96 to 51.5 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of those consulting a doctor has remained relatively stable (around 29 percent), and the percentage consulting a paramedic has significantly decreased. Migration patterns within Nepal reveal significant shifts in trends between 2003-04 and 2022-23. While the overall percentage of the migrant population within the country has remained relatively stable—36.6 percent in 2003-04 and 38.1 percent in 2022-23—there is a notable shift in the gender composition of migrants. Males constituted a higher proportion of migrants in 2003-04 (50.1 percent), but females made a larger share of the migrant population (49.6 percent) in 2022-23. A decline in the percentage of migrants from rural areas in 2022-23 indicates a potential shift in migration patterns, possibly driven by changing economic opportunities and societal factors. The analysis of reasons for migration reveals that family remains the dominant factor (75.2 percent in 2003-04 moving within the country for family reasons and 74.9 percent in 2022-23). The fourth Nepal Living Standards Survey, conducted in 2022-23, is the first such survey since the country’s transition to a federal system. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 9,600 households on a wide range of topics.",https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/16/nepal-s-unemployment-rate-rises-to-12-6-percent-survey-says,money

The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23. Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support. Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72. Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent. According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23. Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867. The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income. The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23. The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population. This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23. The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23. This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23. The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases. There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices. A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices. Cold/fever remains a significant concern, increasing from 43.7 percent in 1995-96 to 51.5 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of those consulting a doctor has remained relatively stable (around 29 percent), and the percentage consulting a paramedic has significantly decreased. Migration patterns within Nepal reveal significant shifts in trends between 2003-04 and 2022-23. While the overall percentage of the migrant population within the country has remained relatively stable—36.6 percent in 2003-04 and 38.1 percent in 2022-23—there is a notable shift in the gender composition of migrants. Males constituted a higher proportion of migrants in 2003-04 (50.1 percent), but females made a larger share of the migrant population (49.6 percent) in 2022-23. A decline in the percentage of migrants from rural areas in 2022-23 indicates a potential shift in migration patterns, possibly driven by changing economic opportunities and societal factors. The analysis of reasons for migration reveals that family remains the dominant factor (75.2 percent in 2003-04 moving within the country for family reasons and 74.9 percent in 2022-23). The fourth Nepal Living Standards Survey, conducted in 2022-23, is the first such survey since the country’s transition to a federal system. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 9,600 households on a wide range of topics.",https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/16/nepal-s-unemployment-rate-rises-to-12-6-percent-survey-says,money

Heading not Found,Anusha Dhakal,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"As John Berger, a prominent art critic and novelist, said, art is the enduring legacy of a generation, preserving the thoughts, beliefs, politics, and passions of an entire era. When all is perished, what remains is art, a reflection of an era’s collective consciousness, preserved for posterity. Art is both the most accessible and spiritual form of an archive, distinct from academic records. It is because, unlike other forms of archives, art captures both the profound and the mundane, even when they lie in striking juxtaposition. It embodies emotions and experiences too complex for words, nurturing the drive in artists of different eras to innovate beyond conventional forms of expression and mediums. The most recent art exhibition at Gallery Mcube’s ‘Young Artists Show’ features ten young artists’ expressions of love, angst, and struggle for the world around them all within one space. This exhibition features stunning, inventive, and evocative artworks that explore a wide range of subjects and emotions. The artworks represent a diverse group of young artists from various parts of Nepal. Harshita Singh’s artwork is the first thing you see as you enter the space. It incorporates her pottery practice and her fascination with the concept of ‘Hamsa’, which represents hands. Her creation is both original and compelling. I found myself staring at artwork for extended periods, trying to unravel its meanings and the artistic processes behind it. Subodh Bhandari and Sambrididhi R Shakya’s ‘What Makes a City’ deserve a larger and extended exhibition because of the issues it raises. This intricate mixed-media features layers of symbolism that will engage art enthusiasts and amateurs alike. With a specific focus on Kathmandu, these works explore the essence of urban life and the difficulties faced by cities, employing materials like plastic sacks, glass, intricate paintwork, and calligraphy. These artworks address Kathmandu’s waste management issues and water scarcity with sensitivity and insight. They also shed light on Nepal’s brain drain problem, highlighting its impact on the city and its inhabitants. Overall, ‘What Makes a City’ by Subodh Bhandari and Sambrididhi R Shakya not only showcases their artistic prowess but also raises important social and environmental issues in a visually compelling and thought-provoking way. As I walked through the exhibition, I came across feathers painted with detailed, lifelike images of different birds hovering around a levitating tree branch in an enthralling spectacle. More feathers scattered all over the floor, each one intricately painted with bird art. I found the concept to be both captivating and innovative, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression with daring experimentation. ‘Hamsa’ by Harshita Singh. This artwork is part of Ronisha Shrestha’s series ‘Abandoned Companions’, in which she compassionately portrays the fate of animals in urban landscapes with incredible empathy. Saran Tandukar’s ‘Scarecrow’ stands out from the rest of the artworks presented in the space. He has collected clothes and fabrics from his community to capture stories, memories, and their essence. His work reflects the migration struggles in our community. He says, “When there is a drought, everybody leaves their home and field, even if they are emotionally connected. The situation forces them to leave everything behind.” He expresses feeling like an abandoned scarecrow in a drought-stricken field, watching his friends and family depart. Just as no one takes a scarecrow when they migrate, he feels as if he is left behind—a sentiment shared by many families and communities in Nepal. The artist’s expertise in working with cloth, particularly in capturing human features, adds an intriguing layer to the piece. His skill in painting with cloth, especially in depicting people's faces and structures, adds a fascinating dimension to the pieces. As part of this series, the exhibition features cubes adorned with levitated fabrics—a sight that further enhances the thematic exploration and visual impact of the artworks on display. The two artworks presented by Rojan Rai, ‘Sweet Smile’ and ‘Bags Full of Uncertainties’, intertwine graffiti-style street art and integrate traditional forms of painting. They feature the essence of daily life through the depiction of the resilience of street vendors. ‘Bags Full of Uncertainties’ depicts a middle-aged street vendor overwhelmed by the number of bags he carries. This painting highlights the burdens of uncertainty while also showcasing the beauty of resilience. It is a poignant and powerful reminder to embrace life’s unpredictability and cherish each moment. The second artwork by Rojan also shows a street vendor, but this one is a child. ‘Sweet Smile’ depicts a little boy selling cotton candy against a backdrop bearing the word ‘SWEET’ in bold graffiti style. The boy’s joyous grin, contrasted against this vivid background, exemplifies the beauty and resilience of ordinary life. Gallery Mcube’s ‘Young Artists Show’ not only exhibits budding artists’ enormous potential but also expresses the new generation's emotions and sociopolitical challenges. It showcases their artistic ability and also addresses important social and environmental issues in visually appealing and innovative ways. The gallery’s initiative to spotlight these talented artists is truly commendable.

Heading not Found,Dil Kumar Ale Magar,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"With a bit of luck Nepal’s fairytale victory would have been secured. The country’s hopes of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup ended after they lost to cricketing powerhouse South Africa by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller in their Group D match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent on Saturday. But their spirited performance earned praise worldwide after almost pulling off an upset win over one of the tournament favourites. Fielding first after winning the toss, the Rhinos restricted a strong Proteas team to a subpar 115-7 with their stupendous spin attack as Dipendra Singh Airee and part-time bowler Kushal Bhurtel shared all seven wickets that fell between them on a turning track. But they fell agonisingly short from recording their historic first ever victory over an ICC’s full-member nation after they could only manage 114-7. Despite the heartbreak, Nepal’s performance caught attention worldwide. “A performance to be proud of. Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter. South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show. “It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.” Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them. “Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.” Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!” “Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?” ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.” At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player. After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result. “We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.” He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].” Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage. Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries. But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase. Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game. Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings. Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand. After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs. But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls. Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat. Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls. Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Sompal Kami consoles Gulsan Jha (right) after Nepal lost their T20 World Cup Group D match against South Africa in Kingstown on Saturday. Hemanta Shrestha/TKP Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target. Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts. Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end. Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings. South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over. Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket. South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control. Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next. South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings. Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls. Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell. “I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said. South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling. “First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said. The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets. South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches. Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note. Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round. The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group.",https://kathmandupost.com/cricket/2024/06/16/nepal-lose-to-south-africa-win-over-the-world,cricket

Heading not Found,Aarati Ray,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Following COVID, we’ve seen a surge in both commercial and experimental films like ‘Kabaddi-4’, ‘Mansarra’, ‘Dimaag Kharab’, ‘The Red Suitcase’, ‘Boksi Ko Ghar’, ‘Farki Farki’, and ‘Gau Aayeko Bato’. These films vary, with some sticking to traditional storytelling while others exploring new and experimental approaches. According to industry insiders, the Nepali movie landscape hasn’t fully realised its potential. Directors, writers, festival organisers, and critics describe an industry muddled between fresh storytelling and repetitive formulas—yet they hope for new talents amidst systemic challenges. Mohan Rai, director of Middleway Films and festival manager for Nepal European Union Film Festival (NEUFF) 2024, notes that both experimental and traditional formulaic movies are currently being produced. He observes that while the industry shows signs towards growth, there is a significant need for improvement in filmmaking techniques, storytelling, and direction. Rai adds, “Both independent and commercial films are important and should complement each other rather than fighting against one another.” Yangesh, a writer and former president of the Film Critics Society of Nepal (FICSON), supports Rai’s views. He says Nepali cinema is heading in the right direction with more diverse film styles. He points out that films like Shambhala and The Red Suitcase making waves at international festivals are promising signs for the industry. Rai adds, “It’s great to see new and young filmmakers emerging with both short and feature films. They’re bringing in diverse stories and characters from various places, languages, and storylines. At this year’s NEUFF, we received 52 Nepali films in the short film category, a big improvement in comparison to the past.” Ramyata Limbu, the director of the Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF), sees a positive trend in the industry, “Rather than good or bad, the key factor is that people are actively telling stories.” As per her, at KIMFF 2024, around 30 films and documentaries were submitted to the Nepali panel. These entries showcased a wide range of narratives and highlighted the diversity in storytelling within the industry. It is evident that the changes are happening, but one wonders how strong the winds of change are blowing. Yangesh opines that despite the new wave of young filmmakers and diverse storytelling, progress is slower than it should be—primarily due to a lack of government support and infrastructure. He further adds that the government’s policies have not been supportive, often imposing taxes and restrictions rather than fostering creativity. “Despite promises, a film city in Dolakha hasn’t materialised, and Kathmandu lacks a decent shooting studio. Private film colleges exist but don’t produce enough skilled technical workers. The government hasn’t organised any significant film festivals or provided subsidies for theatres. Without recognition from banks, the film industry struggles to secure loans and investments,” says Yangesh. The theatres are closing, and the government is not offering incentives for opening new ones or for promoting films at international festivals. Yangesh argues for strategic government planning, private sector investment, and the encouragement of original films. The challenges facing the Nepali film industry are indeed multifaceted. Shanta Nepali, a director, producer and cinematographer, argues that the industry has not been developed sustainably for the long term. She stresses the need for institutional support from the government to help art films reach global platforms. Despite the growth in community funding and international festival entries, she believes the industry requires stronger support to ensure its sustainability. Dipendra Lama, a film journalist turned director, criticises the trend of casting high-priced male stars and relying on them for promotion and funding rather than focusing on the film’s quality. Lama, who is also chairperson of FICSON, emphasises that if a film is made with honesty and effort, it can succeed without a group of big-name stars like ‘Boksi Ko Ghar’. Lama also addresses the issue of repetitive storylines in Nepali cinema. He notes that some movies, like ‘Farki Farki’, rely on old formulas and similar plots, lacking innovation. He advises actors like Anmol KC to choose better scripts and step out of their comfort zones to avoid an unremarkable career. According to Lama, the main challenge is making good films. If a film is strong, it will succeed regardless of external factors. Filmmaker and journalist Sampada Malla, who also works as a creative director of Sarwanam Theatre Group, points out, “Filmmaking isn’t just a hobby. It is a serious career that can influence and inspire millions of people.” Like any other profession, filmmakers should learn to hone their skills. In Nepal, there’s a tendency to rush through film production without doing enough research or putting in hard work, which Malla sees as the greatest obstacle. Sarita Sah, a prominent figure in Nepali film and theatre with over 11 years of experience as an actor, writer, and director, carries a different perspective. According to Sah, Nepali cinema’s biggest challenge is its lack of inclusivity and diversity. She notes that most movies are made with and for audiences from the Hilly and Himalayan regions, neglecting the voices and stories of the Tarai region. She argues that this hampers the industry’s ability to fully represent Nepal’s cultural diversity. Sah emphasises the need for well-informed and empathetic directors and filmmakers to bring out the potential of the Tarai population and every region in cinema. Prabhakar Gautam, a film critic and enthusiast, points out that the Nepali film industry remains largely fixated on so-called ‘mainstream’ and commercial movies. He highlights that films like ‘Kabaddi’ and ‘Jatra’'s success underscore the industry’s inclination towards branding, often favouring sequels over exploring new creative avenues, which poses a crucial challenge. Gautam notes that out of a considerable number of films produced each year, only a handful—approximately 8-10—receive positive responses either at the box office or from critics. He emphasises another challenge: creating good films does not always guarantee a substantial audience. For instance, despite being a well-made film, ‘Ainaa Jhyal Ko Putali’ did not achieve much success, prompting the industry to rethink how to attract audiences to quality films. He also raises concerns about the younger generation of filmmakers lacking support from media highlighting power play and disparities in access to resources and influence. Despite these challenges, there are some promising opportunities for Nepali cinema. The growing interest in diverse stories and the emergence of young filmmakers bring fresh perspectives to the industry. Lama observes that the Nepali film industry has made significant progress since 2014, expanding its market and breaking previous limits. For instance, ‘Kabaddi 4’ recently grossed over 23 crores, which was unthinkable ten years ago. The growing interest of the Nepali diaspora in Nepali films is also a positive sign. He is optimistic about the future, noting the introduction of new technology, young talent, new theatres, and increased audience appreciation. He stresses the importance of focusing on the domestic market first and creating original, authentic stories that reflect Nepali culture. By doing so, Nepali films can compete globally. Lama argues that trying to mimic genres like superhero movies won’t work because those markets are already established. Instead, he suggests drawing inspiration from successful films like the Korean movie ‘Parasite’, which succeeded in America by telling a unique, culturally grounded story. Yangesh believes that Nepal’s film industry needs both government and private sector support to thrive. “Countries like China, Japan, and Korea have boosted their cultural industries through government investments and policy changes. Nepal should follow suit with policies that encourage investment and remove bureaucratic hurdles for filmmakers,” he adds. “Nepal has no shortage of creative ideas and talented young minds today. I foresee positive growth in the coming decade. However, to make this a reality, creating a supportive environment for filmmakers is crucial for Nepali movies to compete globally,” added Sah.",https://kathmandupost.com/movie-review/2024/06/15/nepali-cinema-in-the-eyes-of-industry-insiders,movie-review

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal blew their chances of qualifying for the Super Eight of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup after losing to South Africa by a single run in a last-over nail-biter at the Arnos Vale Ground in West Indies. The Rhinos had everything on the line and were in need of two runs off the last ball of the game when Gulshan Jha was caught between the wickets by Quinton de Kock. Earlier, the Rhinos put up a great bowling display, restricting South Africa, who were sent to bat first, to a lowly total of 115 runs. Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 runs off 11 balls before being dismissed by Dipendra Singh Airee in 3.4 overs. Kushal Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after. Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks managed to stay on the ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavilion by Airee in 15.3 overs. Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play. Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-over spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs. Despite the easy chase, Nepal found themselves on the losing end, putting up 114 runs at a loss of seven wickets at the end of the stipulated 20 overs. The Rhinos were off to a good start with openers Bhurtel and Aashif Sheikh building a decent first-wicket partnership. However, the tides turned quickly for Nepal as South Africa’s Tabraiz Shamsi struck twice in a single over, dismissing Bhurtel for 13 in 7.2 overs, and captain Rohit Paudel for a duck only two deliveries later. Sheikh stood undeterred, building a half-century partnership with Anil Sah to bring some much-needed relief to the Nepali innings. Sah scored 27 runs, which featured three boundaries and a six, before being caught by Marco Jansen off Aiden Markram. Just as the innings were steadying for the Rhinos, Shamsi struck again, proving a thorn in Nepal’s flesh. Nepal were in need of 18 runs off as many deliveries at the end of 16 overs when they dealt a massive blow, losing Dipendra Singh Airee (6), Aasif Sheikh (42) and Kushal Malla (1) in a span of five balls. Tension ran high as Nepal were still in need of eight runs with an over to spare. Gulshan Jha, who took to the field at number seven, missed twice, narrowing the game down to eight runs with four deliveries in hand. Jha then smashed a boundary. The game was down to two runs off as many balls, but he missed again. With only a single delivery remaining, Jha and his partner Sompal Kami made the run for an equaliser, but the former was run out, ending Nepal’s hopes of competing in the World Cup.

Heading not Found,Reuters,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"US President Joe Biden could soon announce a new effort to allow immigrants in the US illegally to obtain legal status if they are married to US citizens, three sources said, an election-year move that could energize some liberal voters. Biden is expected to unveil the effort as soon as Tuesday at a White House event, two of the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal plans still subject to change. Biden, a Democrat, is seeking a second term in the November 5 election that will pit him against Republican challenger Donald Trump, an immigration hardliner. Biden has grappled with record numbers of migrants caught crossing the US-Mexico border illegally on his watch and recently rolled out a restrictive new asylum ban at the border to deter crossers. Some fellow Democrats and immigrant advocates opposed the asylum ban and have called on Biden to protect long-term US residents who lack legal status, including spouses. Reuters reported in April that the White House was considering ways to allow the spouses to obtain legal status. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez did not confirm any coming immigration relief, but said in a statement that Biden officials “remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.” Biden said in June 4 remarks on the asylum ban that in coming weeks he would “speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.” Tuesday’s White House event will be tied to the anniversary of the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The DACA program was launched by former President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Biden and currently grants deportation relief and work permits to 528,000 people brought to the US as children. The US State Department also could roll out new guidance that says DACA recipients should be presumed eligible for non-immigrant visas if they leave the US, one of the sources said. Representative Nanette Barragan, a Democrat and head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said she would attend the White House event and urged Biden to take action to protect spouses of US. citizens and DACA recipients. Barragan said in an interview that Biden could contrast himself with Trump, who has vowed to launch the largest deportation effort in US history. “I think it could be significant for the lives of these people who are living in the shadows, who are married to American citizens and who are under threat of being removed from the country,” she said. An estimated 1.1 million immigrants in the US illegally are married to US citizens, according to data by advocacy organization FWD.us, but how many of those would be included in a possible Biden action remained unclear.",https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/06/15/biden-poised-to-announce-immigration-relief-for-spouses-of-us-citizens-sources-say,world

Representative Nanette Barragan, a Democrat and head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said she would attend the White House event and urged Biden to take action to protect spouses of US. citizens and DACA recipients. Barragan said in an interview that Biden could contrast himself with Trump, who has vowed to launch the largest deportation effort in US history. “I think it could be significant for the lives of these people who are living in the shadows, who are married to American citizens and who are under threat of being removed from the country,” she said. An estimated 1.1 million immigrants in the US illegally are married to US citizens, according to data by advocacy organization FWD.us, but how many of those would be included in a possible Biden action remained unclear.",https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/06/15/biden-poised-to-announce-immigration-relief-for-spouses-of-us-citizens-sources-say,world

The Germans, hunting a record fourth European title and first major trophy after a barren decade, scored through Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and a Kai Havertz penalty before Niclas Fuellkrug and Emre Can added two more late in the second half. Scotland, who had defender Ryan Porteous sent off on the stroke of halftime, got on the scoresheet in the 87th minute courtesy of Antonio Ruediger’s deflected own goal. Julian Nagelsmann’s Germany next face Hungary on Wednesday before taking on Switzerland in their final Group A match. “We played with a lot of intensity and played the right spaces, took some risks and that is why we scored. We played an outstanding first half and we were up 3-0,” Germany captain Ilkay Guendogan said. “That is how we wanted to start. I had a good feeling before the game and I was proved right.” “The start is what we wanted but still the goal we let in showed that all teams have quality and if you don't pay attention you will be punished.” The Scots, who lost Porteous for a studs-up challenge on Guendogan that earned the hosts their penalty, must quickly go back to the drawing board and regroup if they are to make it past the group stage for the first time in a major tournament. POWERFUL START The Germans, who lost their opening matches at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups as well as the previous Euros in 2021, dominated possession from the start with the Scots defending high. That ambitious strategy proved fatal for the visitors, who left far too many open spaces at the back, and it did not take long for the hosts to punish them. Toni Kroos flighted a perfect 30-metre cross for Joshua Kimmich who timed his pass to Wirtz perfectly for the winger to drill home for a 10th minute lead and become the youngest scorer for Germany at a Euros aged 21. With Scotland still recovering, Germany struck again nine minutes later, with Guendogan slipping another ball past the Scottish backline, this time for Havertz on the left, with the forward laying it off for Musiala in the box to rifle home. It was the start all of Germany was hoping for as hundreds of thousands of supporters across several fan zones erupted with joy, but there was more to come with Porteus’ reckless challenge and dismissal conceding a spot kick Havertz easily converted. It was one-way traffic again after the break and Germany added a fourth through substitute Fuellkrug’s fiercely struck shot in the 69th as Scotland coach Steve Clarke, the first man to lead the team to back-to-back Euros, looked on helplessly. “First half, we just got it all wrong really, didn’t show up, weren’t aggressive enough, and we let good players get on the ball,” said Scotland captain Andy Robertson. “Second half, we’re down to 10 men and I thought the lads dug in really well. We have to bounce back quickly because there was lots wrong here and it’s a quick turnaround now.” Scotland, who did not have one effort on or off target, pulled a goal back late on when Ruediger inadvertently headed the ball into his own net but substitute Emre Can then curled home a fine shot in stoppage time for the Germans’ fifth goal.

Heading not Found,Anil Giri,"June 7, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The caretaker Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is all set to take the oath of office for the third constitutive term on Sunday evening, with the invited South Asian leaders to witness the ceremony. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials. Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance. With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade. “India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy. In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences. This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment. “Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement. The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.” Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement. Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them. Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance. Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio. The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA). According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped. “If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak.",https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/07/modi-3-0-all-eyes-on-india-s-nepal-peripheral-policies,politics

Heading not Found,Basant Pratap Singh,"June 5, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nisha Tulachan, an 18-year-old woman from Mustang’s Naurikot, died in her sleep. Her house made up of mud collapsed on her on the night of July 26, 2020 and she died on the spot. Her 70-year-old grandfather was seriously injured. Tulachan’s uncle Shukra Gauchan said that it had been raining for two days before the night of the incident, and their traditional house made of wood, hay, stones, and mud gave in. “There are 28 houses in Naurikot, all built in the traditional style as ours. Rains are unusual in the mountains, so the whole village was shocked,” said Gauchan. Residents of Naurikot who were living in houses with traditional mud roofs, started demolishing and building concrete houses after the incident. Naurikot village lies at an altitude of 2,740 metres in ward 2 of Thasang Rural Municipality, in Mustang. “In the mountain region, traditional mud houses are the best for staying warm, but when rains started becoming more frequent, everybody got scared. People from several other wards of the rural municipality also started building new houses by demolishing the old ones,” Gauchan added. Lo Manthang, which lies at an altitude of 3,840 meters above sea level, is the northernmost settlement in Mustang. The residents of Lo Manthang are also building concrete houses by demolishing traditional mud houses. Prem Hinjing Gurung, a 66-year-old man from Lo Manthang in ward 5 of Lo Manthang Rural Municipality, said that more than 25 houses in the village have been built with concrete now. “Those who could afford, built new concrete houses, and a few families migrated elsewhere,” said Gurung. The statistics of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) also show that heavy rains in Mustang district have started causing extensive damage. According to the NDRRMA website, two houses were completely destroyed due to the heavy rains in the fiscal year 2017-2018, and property worth Rs15.6 million was lost. In 2005, climate change and environment expert Ngamindra Dahal wrote in the Tiempo magazine of the University of East Anglia in the UK that the livelihoods of the locals were being affected when abnormal rains started in the high Himalayan regions like Mustang. Later in 2011, Dahal started further research on climate change in the mountain region. The residents of Mustang and Manang districts told him that their areas were seeing abnormal climate patterns—unexpected rains in summer and less snow in winter. Some locals told Dahal that losing traditional houses also meant losing culture and tradition. Dahal said that due to climate change, monsoon rain, which is generally limited from 2,500-3,000 meters above sea level, is now affecting Mustang and Manang, which are above 3,500 meters. “South Asian monsoons do not go higher than 2,500 to 3,000 meters, but the monsoon has moved up to 4,000 meters in just the last two or three decades,” said Dahal. The geography of Mustang and Manang are very different and sensitive. In the mountain region, where there would be no rainfall, people grew crops using the melted snow. The mountain districts across the Himalayas, which had different seasonal cycles, have now become a monsoon region, Dahal further added. According to a journal article published by Dahal in 2022, the average annual temperature in lower Mustang has increased by 0.021 degrees Celsius per year, and the average annual rainfall has increased by 1.83 millimeters per year in the last 45 years. The data provided in the journal was similar to the temperature and rainfall data recorded at meteorological stations in the lower Mustang region from 1973 to 2018. According to the NDRRMA, there have been five instances of heavy rains and avalanches in Mustang and Manang since the fiscal year 2014-2015. Similarly, the two districts saw 32 landslides and 19 incidents of flooding since then. In Mustang alone, 31 houses were completely destroyed by floods in four places in the last monsoon season. Similarly, 16 houses were partially damaged, and more than 35 families were affected. The floods on May 28, 2021, and June 15, 2021, damaged property worth Rs3 billion, destroying houses, bridges, schools, and roads, among other infrastructures, in Nason, Chame, and Manang Nesyang rural municipalities of Manang district. According to the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, the rainfall measurement station at Humde in Manang recorded 82.2 mm of rain on June 15, 2021. In Humde, the average rainfall in June 2015 was 42 mm, but in June 2021, the area saw 197 mm of rainfall in a period of 15 days. This was 469 percent more than that of June 2015 average. In May 2021, the area recorded 693 percent more rain compared to the same period in 2015. The change in the timing of seasonal rainfall has also impacted agriculture in mountain districts. Farmers in high altitude areas are facing challenges in protecting their crops—they grow mainly potato, wheat, barley and buckwheat—as the temperature increases and the pattern of rain changes. Aaita Bahadur Thakali, a local farmer from ward 5 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality, Mustang, reported a decline in crop yields. According to Karma Gurung from Dhumba in Gharpajhong Rural Municipality, Mustang, who has been involved in commercial cultivation of apples for decades, the district produced 5,464 metric tons of apples on 520 hectares in the fiscal year 2021-2022. Although the apple growing area has expanded to 1,400 hectares, the total production was only 6,250 metric tons in the fiscal year 2023-24. Madan Regmi, head of the Agriculture Knowledge Centre in Manang, said that on April 26, it snowed in upper Manang damaging the apple flowers. Also, the activity of helpful insects in pollination (bees and bumblebees) was subdued as the temperature was below the freezing point. “Unexpected weather events, which have become more frequent, during the main season, have hit crop yields badly,” said Regmi. “Not just apples, but vegetable production has also been affected—by the cold. The lower areas of Manang that used to receive monsoon rains, have been seeing dry monsoons for the past few years. The earlier rain shadow region in the highlands, have been seeing heavy rainfall during the monsoon for the past few years. These unexpected shifts in rain patterns have hit farmers the most,” Regmi added. Locals say a pine species locally called Sang tree found in the upper Mustang region and used for worship and other rituals, are also disappearing due to climate change. According to a report published by the National Statistics Office, 47.1 percent of the families in the Himalayan region of Gandaki Province participating in the survey said that they have felt the effects of climate change in the last 25 years. In the Gandaki province, 39.5 percent of families said that new diseases and insects have appeared in crops over the past 25 years. Similarly, 97.4 percent families in Gandaki are not aware of the early warning of climate disasters, according to the office’s survey. The chief district officer of Mustang, Janakraj Panta, who is also the chairman of the District Disaster Management Committee, said that the local governments are working on climate adaptation and risk reduction to the best of their abilities, but these efforts are not enough. “The situation has gone beyond the control of the local government and the district authorities. The provincial and federal governments are also aware of the climate-induced disasters, but have not been taking mitigation measures,” said Pant. “The more the delay in implementing long-term programmes, the more the likelihood of further damage,” Pant added. Environment expert Dahal said the federal and provincial governments should take the initiative to implement long-term climate adaptation and disaster mitigation measures.",https://kathmandupost.com/climate-environment/2024/06/05/climate-change-hits-mountain-people-on-multiple-fronts,climate-environment

Naurikot village lies at an altitude of 2,740 metres in ward 2 of Thasang Rural Municipality, in Mustang. “In the mountain region, traditional mud houses are the best for staying warm, but when rains started becoming more frequent, everybody got scared. People from several other wards of the rural municipality also started building new houses by demolishing the old ones,” Gauchan added. Lo Manthang, which lies at an altitude of 3,840 meters above sea level, is the northernmost settlement in Mustang. The residents of Lo Manthang are also building concrete houses by demolishing traditional mud houses. Prem Hinjing Gurung, a 66-year-old man from Lo Manthang in ward 5 of Lo Manthang Rural Municipality, said that more than 25 houses in the village have been built with concrete now. “Those who could afford, built new concrete houses, and a few families migrated elsewhere,” said Gurung. The statistics of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) also show that heavy rains in Mustang district have started causing extensive damage. According to the NDRRMA website, two houses were completely destroyed due to the heavy rains in the fiscal year 2017-2018, and property worth Rs15.6 million was lost. In 2005, climate change and environment expert Ngamindra Dahal wrote in the Tiempo magazine of the University of East Anglia in the UK that the livelihoods of the locals were being affected when abnormal rains started in the high Himalayan regions like Mustang. Later in 2011, Dahal started further research on climate change in the mountain region. The residents of Mustang and Manang districts told him that their areas were seeing abnormal climate patterns—unexpected rains in summer and less snow in winter. Some locals told Dahal that losing traditional houses also meant losing culture and tradition. Dahal said that due to climate change, monsoon rain, which is generally limited from 2,500-3,000 meters above sea level, is now affecting Mustang and Manang, which are above 3,500 meters. “South Asian monsoons do not go higher than 2,500 to 3,000 meters, but the monsoon has moved up to 4,000 meters in just the last two or three decades,” said Dahal. The geography of Mustang and Manang are very different and sensitive. In the mountain region, where there would be no rainfall, people grew crops using the melted snow. The mountain districts across the Himalayas, which had different seasonal cycles, have now become a monsoon region, Dahal further added. According to a journal article published by Dahal in 2022, the average annual temperature in lower Mustang has increased by 0.021 degrees Celsius per year, and the average annual rainfall has increased by 1.83 millimeters per year in the last 45 years. The data provided in the journal was similar to the temperature and rainfall data recorded at meteorological stations in the lower Mustang region from 1973 to 2018. According to the NDRRMA, there have been five instances of heavy rains and avalanches in Mustang and Manang since the fiscal year 2014-2015. Similarly, the two districts saw 32 landslides and 19 incidents of flooding since then. In Mustang alone, 31 houses were completely destroyed by floods in four places in the last monsoon season. Similarly, 16 houses were partially damaged, and more than 35 families were affected. The floods on May 28, 2021, and June 15, 2021, damaged property worth Rs3 billion, destroying houses, bridges, schools, and roads, among other infrastructures, in Nason, Chame, and Manang Nesyang rural municipalities of Manang district. According to the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, the rainfall measurement station at Humde in Manang recorded 82.2 mm of rain on June 15, 2021. In Humde, the average rainfall in June 2015 was 42 mm, but in June 2021, the area saw 197 mm of rainfall in a period of 15 days. This was 469 percent more than that of June 2015 average. In May 2021, the area recorded 693 percent more rain compared to the same period in 2015. The change in the timing of seasonal rainfall has also impacted agriculture in mountain districts. Farmers in high altitude areas are facing challenges in protecting their crops—they grow mainly potato, wheat, barley and buckwheat—as the temperature increases and the pattern of rain changes. Aaita Bahadur Thakali, a local farmer from ward 5 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality, Mustang, reported a decline in crop yields. According to Karma Gurung from Dhumba in Gharpajhong Rural Municipality, Mustang, who has been involved in commercial cultivation of apples for decades, the district produced 5,464 metric tons of apples on 520 hectares in the fiscal year 2021-2022. Although the apple growing area has expanded to 1,400 hectares, the total production was only 6,250 metric tons in the fiscal year 2023-24. Madan Regmi, head of the Agriculture Knowledge Centre in Manang, said that on April 26, it snowed in upper Manang damaging the apple flowers. Also, the activity of helpful insects in pollination (bees and bumblebees) was subdued as the temperature was below the freezing point. “Unexpected weather events, which have become more frequent, during the main season, have hit crop yields badly,” said Regmi. “Not just apples, but vegetable production has also been affected—by the cold. The lower areas of Manang that used to receive monsoon rains, have been seeing dry monsoons for the past few years. The earlier rain shadow region in the highlands, have been seeing heavy rainfall during the monsoon for the past few years. These unexpected shifts in rain patterns have hit farmers the most,” Regmi added. Locals say a pine species locally called Sang tree found in the upper Mustang region and used for worship and other rituals, are also disappearing due to climate change. According to a report published by the National Statistics Office, 47.1 percent of the families in the Himalayan region of Gandaki Province participating in the survey said that they have felt the effects of climate change in the last 25 years. In the Gandaki province, 39.5 percent of families said that new diseases and insects have appeared in crops over the past 25 years. Similarly, 97.4 percent families in Gandaki are not aware of the early warning of climate disasters, according to the office’s survey. The chief district officer of Mustang, Janakraj Panta, who is also the chairman of the District Disaster Management Committee, said that the local governments are working on climate adaptation and risk reduction to the best of their abilities, but these efforts are not enough. “The situation has gone beyond the control of the local government and the district authorities. The provincial and federal governments are also aware of the climate-induced disasters, but have not been taking mitigation measures,” said Pant. “The more the delay in implementing long-term programmes, the more the likelihood of further damage,” Pant added. Environment expert Dahal said the federal and provincial governments should take the initiative to implement long-term climate adaptation and disaster mitigation measures.",https://kathmandupost.com/climate-environment/2024/06/05/climate-change-hits-mountain-people-on-multiple-fronts,climate-environment

With the Supreme Court issuing its full text of the verdict on May 11, opposition party leaders have started questioning the CPN-UML about “policy corruption” committed in the process. The Nepali Congress leaders have demanded a probe into the Oli government’s decision. Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption. The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament. “No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,” said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice. Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill. Some of its lawmakers like Radheshyam Adhikari had criticised it strongly in the Upper House. However, it wasn't objected to by the Congress while endorsing it. Experts say this is an example of how laws are passed in Nepal. The executive includes provisions that allow for policy corruption, and these are endorsed as lawmakers do not care to engage in a thorough study and deliberations over the bill. “Policy corruption at the executive level can be checked if the lawmakers are vigilant and lawmaking is transparent,” Khimlal Devkota, a former National Assembly member who has closely studied Nepal’s law-making process, told the Post. Policy decisions in Nepal have become rather controversial. Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it. As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’. Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason. The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal. The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House. Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. “The lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process. “The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.” Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process. Talking to law students on Sunday, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri said the government was creating a Suggestion Bank to receive feedback on bills. “Such feedback and suggestions will be incorporated in the bills,” he said.",https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/06/lawmakers-ignorance-of-provisions-in-bills-fuels-policy-corruption,politics

Heading not Found,Sucheta Pyakuryal,"June 2, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress. In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew , need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy. Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men. Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita . The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature. Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities.

Heading not Found,Krishana Prasain,"June 9, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"After three years of halt, the much-awaited 5G frequency is set to be auctioned in Nepal. “The telecom regulator is ready to allow 5G frequency, and we are waiting for service providers’ response,” said Pradip Paudyal, deputy director of Nepal Telecommunications Authority. Paudyal, however, didn’t mention the auction date. “We have decided to auction the 5G frequency and are preparing for it,” he said. Paudyal said that to take part in the auction, service providers should clear all the dues they owe to the government. 5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology, offers 10 times faster internet speed than its predecessor 4G and supports 10 times more devices per square kilometre. The state-owned phone company has announced several launch dates, but they have always been postponed for no apparent reason. The 5G rollout was originally planned in 2021 but came to an abrupt halt, which insiders said was due to geopolitics. American and Indian embassies’ officials recently told the Post that they were concerned about the Nepal government allowing the Chinese companies to conduct the 5G tests without going through a competitive bidding process. Nepal Telecom has also been saying that there aren’t enough 5G compatible phones in Kathmandu and other cities to warrant launching the new technology. But records show that millions of mobile phones with advanced features have been imported in the past two years. The rollout plan has been revived after the formation of the new government, which, according to insiders, is close to its northern neighbour, China, which has installed and supplied 5G equipment. “We introduced the new frequency policy around four months ago. Under this policy, all frequencies will go into technology neutrality from the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25,” said Paudyal. Technology neutrality allows service providers to use any technology in a given frequency, he said. Currently, there are two telecom service providers operating in the country—Telecom and Ncell. According to the telecom regulator, service providers can introduce 5G technology using existing frequencies or new ones. The authority says it is prepared to provide new frequencies through auction. Nepal Telecom was provided with a 2,600 Mhz frequency for the 5G trial. The authority provided the frequency for a year, and Nepal Telecom conducted an internal trial for around 2-3 months last October. It was said that Nepal Telecom would conduct a trial among the public, but that wasn’t meant to be. The regulator has written to Nepal Telecom to submit a report on the 5G trial. “Once it receives the report, the authority will proceed accordingly,” Paudyal said. While the government said it is ready to introduce 5G technology, the service providers said that since building the 5G ecosystem requires huge investment and as the country’s current economic situation is not so good, the market is not ready for the new mobile technology. It is estimated that service providers need to invest around Rs50-60 billion to implement 5G technology. Both the market and consumers are not ready for the technology, and there are device constraints, too. According to service providers, though mobile phone users’ demands have been growing in Nepal, daily data usage remains very low. Only two out of 10 Nepalis use mobile data regularly, according to Ncell, the private telecom provider. Ncell said in a recent statement that the average monthly data consumption per customer is only 4GB, which is low compared to other neighbouring countries. The telecom service providers are losing money and have outstanding dues due to the reduction in income. When Ncell introduced 4G in 2017, its annual income was Rs58-59 billion, which has now declined to Rs33-35 billion. Similarly, Nepal Telecom’s profit declined to Rs7.8 billion in the last fiscal year from Rs15.01 billion in 2017. According to a report by Cable.co.uk , the mobile data price measured from June to September 2023 is $0.43, or Rs57.38. The average cost of 1GB of data in India is $0.16, $0.12 in Pakistan, $0.23 in Bangladesh, $0.25 in Sri Lanka, $0.71 in Bhutan, and $2.16 in the Maldives. Mobile data prices are expensive in Nepal compared to other South Asian countries. Nepal Telecom concluded the 5G trial in four places in certain mobile sets to check whether the technology supports our network, said Hari Dhakal, spokesperson of Nepal Telecom. “As it requires a huge investment to bring the technology, we need to look at the cost, market readiness, return and other factors. So it will be difficult for us to go to the public immediately and we will not bring it unless we are assured of all the factors.” Jabbor Kayumov, CEO of Ncell, told a recent press meeting that after India, Ncell was looking to make Nepal the first country in South Asia to introduce 5G commercially. “But to get there, we need to take an important first step, and that is we need every Nepali to start using their mobile phones productively which means keeping mobile data always on.” Also, the government needs to create favourable conditions and reform laws to bring the new technology, company insiders say. For instance, a case involving Nepal Telecom and Ncell is under the court’s consideration. The government is forcefully asking telecom service providers to clear the frequency amount before the auction of 2,100 Mhz by bringing retrospective law, insiders say. 3G was introduced in Nepal in 2007 and 4G in 2017. After the government announced an ‘economic decade’, digital economy topics are coming to the fore. “For a digital economy, digital transformation is necessary, which in turn calls for 5G technology. This is why the government has prioritised 5G,” Paudyal said. According to the 61st annual report of the Auditor General, Nepal Telecom spent Rs18.43 million for the trial of 5G in the current fiscal year. The audit has suggested that the company needs to be more effective in the implementation of 5G technology.",https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/09/after-3-years-nepal-dusts-off-plan-to-launch-5g,money

Heading not Found,Krishana Prasain,"June 9, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"After three years of halt, the much-awaited 5G frequency is set to be auctioned in Nepal. “The telecom regulator is ready to allow 5G frequency, and we are waiting for service providers’ response,” said Pradip Paudyal, deputy director of Nepal Telecommunications Authority. Paudyal, however, didn’t mention the auction date. “We have decided to auction the 5G frequency and are preparing for it,” he said. Paudyal said that to take part in the auction, service providers should clear all the dues they owe to the government. 5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology, offers 10 times faster internet speed than its predecessor 4G and supports 10 times more devices per square kilometre. The state-owned phone company has announced several launch dates, but they have always been postponed for no apparent reason. The 5G rollout was originally planned in 2021 but came to an abrupt halt, which insiders said was due to geopolitics. American and Indian embassies’ officials recently told the Post that they were concerned about the Nepal government allowing the Chinese companies to conduct the 5G tests without going through a competitive bidding process. Nepal Telecom has also been saying that there aren’t enough 5G compatible phones in Kathmandu and other cities to warrant launching the new technology. But records show that millions of mobile phones with advanced features have been imported in the past two years. The rollout plan has been revived after the formation of the new government, which, according to insiders, is close to its northern neighbour, China, which has installed and supplied 5G equipment. “We introduced the new frequency policy around four months ago. Under this policy, all frequencies will go into technology neutrality from the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25,” said Paudyal. Technology neutrality allows service providers to use any technology in a given frequency, he said. Currently, there are two telecom service providers operating in the country—Telecom and Ncell. According to the telecom regulator, service providers can introduce 5G technology using existing frequencies or new ones. The authority says it is prepared to provide new frequencies through auction. Nepal Telecom was provided with a 2,600 Mhz frequency for the 5G trial. The authority provided the frequency for a year, and Nepal Telecom conducted an internal trial for around 2-3 months last October. It was said that Nepal Telecom would conduct a trial among the public, but that wasn’t meant to be. The regulator has written to Nepal Telecom to submit a report on the 5G trial. “Once it receives the report, the authority will proceed accordingly,” Paudyal said. While the government said it is ready to introduce 5G technology, the service providers said that since building the 5G ecosystem requires huge investment and as the country’s current economic situation is not so good, the market is not ready for the new mobile technology. It is estimated that service providers need to invest around Rs50-60 billion to implement 5G technology. Both the market and consumers are not ready for the technology, and there are device constraints, too. According to service providers, though mobile phone users’ demands have been growing in Nepal, daily data usage remains very low. Only two out of 10 Nepalis use mobile data regularly, according to Ncell, the private telecom provider. Ncell said in a recent statement that the average monthly data consumption per customer is only 4GB, which is low compared to other neighbouring countries. The telecom service providers are losing money and have outstanding dues due to the reduction in income. When Ncell introduced 4G in 2017, its annual income was Rs58-59 billion, which has now declined to Rs33-35 billion. Similarly, Nepal Telecom’s profit declined to Rs7.8 billion in the last fiscal year from Rs15.01 billion in 2017. According to a report by Cable.co.uk , the mobile data price measured from June to September 2023 is $0.43, or Rs57.38.

When all is perished, what remains is art, a reflection of an era’s collective consciousness, preserved for posterity. Art is both the most accessible and spiritual form of an archive, distinct from academic records. It is because, unlike other forms of archives, art captures both the profound and the mundane, even when they lie in striking juxtaposition. It embodies emotions and experiences too complex for words, nurturing the drive in artists of different eras to innovate beyond conventional forms of expression and mediums. The most recent art exhibition at Gallery Mcube’s ‘Young Artists Show’ features ten young artists’ expressions of love, angst, and struggle for the world around them all within one space. This exhibition features stunning, inventive, and evocative artworks that explore a wide range of subjects and emotions. The artworks represent a diverse group of young artists from various parts of Nepal. Harshita Singh’s artwork is the first thing you see as you enter the space. It incorporates her pottery practice and her fascination with the concept of ‘Hamsa’, which represents hands. Her creation is both original and compelling. I found myself staring at artwork for extended periods, trying to unravel its meanings and the artistic processes behind it. Subodh Bhandari and Sambrididhi R Shakya’s ‘What Makes a City’ deserve a larger and extended exhibition because of the issues it raises. This intricate mixed-media features layers of symbolism that will engage art enthusiasts and amateurs alike. With a specific focus on Kathmandu, these works explore the essence of urban life and the difficulties faced by cities, employing materials like plastic sacks, glass, intricate paintwork, and calligraphy. These artworks address Kathmandu’s waste management issues and water scarcity with sensitivity and insight. They also shed light on Nepal’s brain drain problem, highlighting its impact on the city and its inhabitants. Overall, ‘What Makes a City’ by Subodh Bhandari and Sambrididhi R Shakya not only showcases their artistic prowess but also raises important social and environmental issues in a visually compelling and thought-provoking way. As I walked through the exhibition, I came across feathers painted with detailed, lifelike images of different birds hovering around a levitating tree branch in an enthralling spectacle. More feathers scattered all over the floor, each one intricately painted with bird art. I found the concept to be both captivating and innovative, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression with daring experimentation. ‘Hamsa’ by Harshita Singh. This artwork is part of Ronisha Shrestha’s series ‘Abandoned Companions’, in which she compassionately portrays the fate of animals in urban landscapes with incredible empathy. Saran Tandukar’s ‘Scarecrow’ stands out from the rest of the artworks presented in the space. He has collected clothes and fabrics from his community to capture stories, memories, and their essence. His work reflects the migration struggles in our community. He says, “When there is a drought, everybody leaves their home and field, even if they are emotionally connected. The situation forces them to leave everything behind.” He expresses feeling like an abandoned scarecrow in a drought-stricken field, watching his friends and family depart. Just as no one takes a scarecrow when they migrate, he feels as if he is left behind—a sentiment shared by many families and communities in Nepal. The artist’s expertise in working with cloth, particularly in capturing human features, adds an intriguing layer to the piece. His skill in painting with cloth, especially in depicting people's faces and structures, adds a fascinating dimension to the pieces. As part of this series, the exhibition features cubes adorned with levitated fabrics—a sight that further enhances the thematic exploration and visual impact of the artworks on display. The two artworks presented by Rojan Rai, ‘Sweet Smile’ and ‘Bags Full of Uncertainties’, intertwine graffiti-style street art and integrate traditional forms of painting. They feature the essence of daily life through the depiction of the resilience of street vendors. ‘Bags Full of Uncertainties’ depicts a middle-aged street vendor overwhelmed by the number of bags he carries. This painting highlights the burdens of uncertainty while also showcasing the beauty of resilience. It is a poignant and powerful reminder to embrace life’s unpredictability and cherish each moment. The second artwork by Rojan also shows a street vendor, but this one is a child. ‘Sweet Smile’ depicts a little boy selling cotton candy against a backdrop bearing the word ‘SWEET’ in bold graffiti style. The boy’s joyous grin, contrasted against this vivid background, exemplifies the beauty and resilience of ordinary life. Gallery Mcube’s ‘Young Artists Show’ not only exhibits budding artists’ enormous potential but also expresses the new generation's emotions and sociopolitical challenges. It showcases their artistic ability and also addresses important social and environmental issues in visually appealing and innovative ways.

Heading not Found,Aarati Ray,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Following COVID, we’ve seen a surge in both commercial and experimental films like ‘Kabaddi-4’, ‘Mansarra’, ‘Dimaag Kharab’, ‘The Red Suitcase’, ‘Boksi Ko Ghar’, ‘Farki Farki’, and ‘Gau Aayeko Bato’. These films vary, with some sticking to traditional storytelling while others exploring new and experimental approaches. According to industry insiders, the Nepali movie landscape hasn’t fully realised its potential. Directors, writers, festival organisers, and critics describe an industry muddled between fresh storytelling and repetitive formulas—yet they hope for new talents amidst systemic challenges. Mohan Rai, director of Middleway Films and festival manager for Nepal European Union Film Festival (NEUFF) 2024, notes that both experimental and traditional formulaic movies are currently being produced. He observes that while the industry shows signs towards growth, there is a significant need for improvement in filmmaking techniques, storytelling, and direction. Rai adds, “Both independent and commercial films are important and should complement each other rather than fighting against one another.” Yangesh, a writer and former president of the Film Critics Society of Nepal (FICSON), supports Rai’s views. He says Nepali cinema is heading in the right direction with more diverse film styles. He points out that films like Shambhala and The Red Suitcase making waves at international festivals are promising signs for the industry. Rai adds, “It’s great to see new and young filmmakers emerging with both short and feature films. They’re bringing in diverse stories and characters from various places, languages, and storylines. At this year’s NEUFF, we received 52 Nepali films in the short film category, a big improvement in comparison to the past.” Ramyata Limbu, the director of the Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF), sees a positive trend in the industry, “Rather than good or bad, the key factor is that people are actively telling stories.” As per her, at KIMFF 2024, around 30 films and documentaries were submitted to the Nepali panel. These entries showcased a wide range of narratives and highlighted the diversity in storytelling within the industry. It is evident that the changes are happening, but one wonders how strong the winds of change are blowing. Yangesh opines that despite the new wave of young filmmakers and diverse storytelling, progress is slower than it should be—primarily due to a lack of government support and infrastructure. He further adds that the government’s policies have not been supportive, often imposing taxes and restrictions rather than fostering creativity. “Despite promises, a film city in Dolakha hasn’t materialised, and Kathmandu lacks a decent shooting studio. Private film colleges exist but don’t produce enough skilled technical workers. The government hasn’t organised any significant film festivals or provided subsidies for theatres. Without recognition from banks, the film industry struggles to secure loans and investments,” says Yangesh. The theatres are closing, and the government is not offering incentives for opening new ones or for promoting films at international festivals. Yangesh argues for strategic government planning, private sector investment, and the encouragement of original films. The challenges facing the Nepali film industry are indeed multifaceted. Shanta Nepali, a director, producer and cinematographer, argues that the industry has not been developed sustainably for the long term. She stresses the need for institutional support from the government to help art films reach global platforms. Despite the growth in community funding and international festival entries, she believes the industry requires stronger support to ensure its sustainability. Dipendra Lama, a film journalist turned director, criticises the trend of casting high-priced male stars and relying on them for promotion and funding rather than focusing on the film’s quality. Lama, who is also chairperson of FICSON, emphasises that if a film is made with honesty and effort, it can succeed without a group of big-name stars like ‘Boksi Ko Ghar’. Lama also addresses the issue of repetitive storylines in Nepali cinema. He notes that some movies, like ‘Farki Farki’, rely on old formulas and similar plots, lacking innovation. He advises actors like Anmol KC to choose better scripts and step out of their comfort zones to avoid an unremarkable career. According to Lama, the main challenge is making good films. If a film is strong, it will succeed regardless of external factors. Filmmaker and journalist Sampada Malla, who also works as a creative director of Sarwanam Theatre Group, points out, “Filmmaking isn’t just a hobby. It is a serious career that can influence and inspire millions of people.” Like any other profession, filmmakers should learn to hone their skills. In Nepal, there’s a tendency to rush through film production without doing enough research or putting in hard work, which Malla sees as the greatest obstacle. Sarita Sah, a prominent figure in Nepali film and theatre with over 11 years of experience as an actor, writer, and director, carries a different perspective. According to Sah, Nepali cinema’s biggest challenge is its lack of inclusivity and diversity. She notes that most movies are made with and for audiences from the Hilly and Himalayan regions, neglecting the voices and stories of the Tarai region. She argues that this hampers the industry’s ability to fully represent Nepal’s cultural diversity. Sah emphasises the need for well-informed and empathetic directors and filmmakers to bring out the potential of the Tarai population and every region in cinema. Prabhakar Gautam, a film critic and enthusiast, points out that the Nepali film industry remains largely fixated on so-called ‘mainstream’ and commercial movies. He highlights that films like ‘Kabaddi’ and ‘Jatra’'s success underscore the industry’s inclination towards branding, often favouring sequels over exploring new creative avenues, which poses a crucial challenge. Gautam notes that out of a considerable number of films produced each year, only a handful—approximately 8-10—receive positive responses either at the box office or from critics. He emphasises another challenge: creating good films does not always guarantee a substantial audience. For instance, despite being a well-made film, ‘Ainaa Jhyal Ko Putali’ did not achieve much success, prompting the industry to rethink how to attract audiences to quality films. He also raises concerns about the younger generation of filmmakers lacking support from media highlighting power play and disparities in access to resources and influence. Despite these challenges, there are some promising opportunities for Nepali cinema. The growing interest in diverse stories and the emergence of young filmmakers bring fresh perspectives to the industry. Lama observes that the Nepali film industry has made significant progress since 2014, expanding its market and breaking previous limits. For instance, ‘Kabaddi 4’ recently grossed over 23 crores, which was unthinkable ten years ago. The growing interest of the Nepali diaspora in Nepali films is also a positive sign. He is optimistic about the future, noting the introduction of new technology, young talent, new theatres, and increased audience appreciation. He stresses the importance of focusing on the domestic market first and creating original, authentic stories that reflect Nepali culture. By doing so, Nepali films can compete globally. Lama argues that trying to mimic genres like superhero movies won’t work because those markets are already established.

Heading not Found,Aarati Ray,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Following COVID, we’ve seen a surge in both commercial and experimental films like ‘Kabaddi-4’, ‘Mansarra’, ‘Dimaag Kharab’, ‘The Red Suitcase’, ‘Boksi Ko Ghar’, ‘Farki Farki’, and ‘Gau Aayeko Bato’. These films vary, with some sticking to traditional storytelling while others exploring new and experimental approaches. According to industry insiders, the Nepali movie landscape hasn’t fully realised its potential. Directors, writers, festival organisers, and critics describe an industry muddled between fresh storytelling and repetitive formulas—yet they hope for new talents amidst systemic challenges. Mohan Rai, director of Middleway Films and festival manager for Nepal European Union Film Festival (NEUFF) 2024, notes that both experimental and traditional formulaic movies are currently being produced. He observes that while the industry shows signs towards growth, there is a significant need for improvement in filmmaking techniques, storytelling, and direction. Rai adds, “Both independent and commercial films are important and should complement each other rather than fighting against one another.” Yangesh, a writer and former president of the Film Critics Society of Nepal (FICSON), supports Rai’s views. He says Nepali cinema is heading in the right direction with more diverse film styles. He points out that films like Shambhala and The Red Suitcase making waves at international festivals are promising signs for the industry. Rai adds, “It’s great to see new and young filmmakers emerging with both short and feature films. They’re bringing in diverse stories and characters from various places, languages, and storylines. At this year’s NEUFF, we received 52 Nepali films in the short film category, a big improvement in comparison to the past.” Ramyata Limbu, the director of the Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF), sees a positive trend in the industry, “Rather than good or bad, the key factor is that people are actively telling stories.” As per her, at KIMFF 2024, around 30 films and documentaries were submitted to the Nepali panel. These entries showcased a wide range of narratives and highlighted the diversity in storytelling within the industry. It is evident that the changes are happening, but one wonders how strong the winds of change are blowing. Yangesh opines that despite the new wave of young filmmakers and diverse storytelling, progress is slower than it should be—primarily due to a lack of government support and infrastructure. He further adds that the government’s policies have not been supportive, often imposing taxes and restrictions rather than fostering creativity. “Despite promises, a film city in Dolakha hasn’t materialised, and Kathmandu lacks a decent shooting studio. Private film colleges exist but don’t produce enough skilled technical workers. The government hasn’t organised any significant film festivals or provided subsidies for theatres. Without recognition from banks, the film industry struggles to secure loans and investments,” says Yangesh. The theatres are closing, and the government is not offering incentives for opening new ones or for promoting films at international festivals. Yangesh argues for strategic government planning, private sector investment, and the encouragement of original films. The challenges facing the Nepali film industry are indeed multifaceted. Shanta Nepali, a director, producer and cinematographer, argues that the industry has not been developed sustainably for the long term. She stresses the need for institutional support from the government to help art films reach global platforms. Despite the growth in community funding and international festival entries, she believes the industry requires stronger support to ensure its sustainability. Dipendra Lama, a film journalist turned director, criticises the trend of casting high-priced male stars and relying on them for promotion and funding rather than focusing on the film’s quality. Lama, who is also chairperson of FICSON, emphasises that if a film is made with honesty and effort, it can succeed without a group of big-name stars like ‘Boksi Ko Ghar’. Lama also addresses the issue of repetitive storylines in Nepali cinema. He notes that some movies, like ‘Farki Farki’, rely on old formulas and similar plots, lacking innovation. He advises actors like Anmol KC to choose better scripts and step out of their comfort zones to avoid an unremarkable career. According to Lama, the main challenge is making good films. If a film is strong, it will succeed regardless of external factors. Filmmaker and journalist Sampada Malla, who also works as a creative director of Sarwanam Theatre Group, points out, “Filmmaking isn’t just a hobby. It is a serious career that can influence and inspire millions of people.” Like any other profession, filmmakers should learn to hone their skills. In Nepal, there’s a tendency to rush through film production without doing enough research or putting in hard work, which Malla sees as the greatest obstacle. Sarita Sah, a prominent figure in Nepali film and theatre with over 11 years of experience as an actor, writer, and director, carries a different perspective. According to Sah, Nepali cinema’s biggest challenge is its lack of inclusivity and diversity. She notes that most movies are made with and for audiences from the Hilly and Himalayan regions, neglecting the voices and stories of the Tarai region. She argues that this hampers the industry’s ability to fully represent Nepal’s cultural diversity. Sah emphasises the need for well-informed and empathetic directors and filmmakers to bring out the potential of the Tarai population and every region in cinema. Prabhakar Gautam, a film critic and enthusiast, points out that the Nepali film industry remains largely fixated on so-called ‘mainstream’ and commercial movies. He highlights that films like ‘Kabaddi’ and ‘Jatra’'s success underscore the industry’s inclination towards branding, often favouring sequels over exploring new creative avenues, which poses a crucial challenge. Gautam notes that out of a considerable number of films produced each year, only a handful—approximately 8-10—receive positive responses either at the box office or from critics. He emphasises another challenge: creating good films does not always guarantee a substantial audience. For instance, despite being a well-made film, ‘Ainaa Jhyal Ko Putali’ did not achieve much success, prompting the industry to rethink how to attract audiences to quality films. He also raises concerns about the younger generation of filmmakers lacking support from media highlighting power play and disparities in access to resources and influence. Despite these challenges, there are some promising opportunities for Nepali cinema. The growing interest in diverse stories and the emergence of young filmmakers bring fresh perspectives to the industry. Lama observes that the Nepali film industry has made significant progress since 2014, expanding its market and breaking previous limits. For instance, ‘Kabaddi 4’ recently grossed over 23 crores, which was unthinkable ten years ago. The growing interest of the Nepali diaspora in Nepali films is also a positive sign. He is optimistic about the future, noting the introduction of new technology, young talent, new theatres, and increased audience appreciation. He stresses the importance of focusing on the domestic market first and creating original, authentic stories that reflect Nepali culture. By doing so, Nepali films can compete globally. Lama argues that trying to mimic genres like superhero movies won’t work because those markets are already established. Instead, he suggests drawing inspiration from successful films like the Korean movie ‘Parasite’, which succeeded in America by telling a unique, culturally grounded story. Yangesh believes that Nepal’s film industry needs both government and private sector support to thrive. “Countries like China, Japan, and Korea have boosted their cultural industries through government investments and policy changes. Nepal should follow suit with policies that encourage investment and remove bureaucratic hurdles for filmmakers,” he adds. “Nepal has no shortage of creative ideas and talented young minds today.

Heading not Found,Rishika Dhakal,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Why do we romanticise the dead? Why can’t we be honest about them? Especially moms. They’re the most romanticised of anyone.” One rarely comes across a book titled ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’. My first thought after stumbling onto this literary piece was what possibly could have been the author’s grudge towards her mother for naming the book with such an abrasive title. And quite fittingly, the title has made its mark by drawing attention from readers worldwide, making the book a New York Times bestseller. American writer, filmmaker, former actress, and singer Jennette McCurdy has created a stir in the literary scene with her debut book, ‘I’m glad my mom died’. The book’s main theme revolves around the complicated relationship between the author and her mother. The book also explores other themes such as abuse, child stardom and exploitation, eating disorders, grief and healing, and finally, resilience and survival. The memoir opens with the celebration of McCurdy’s sixth birthday when her mom presents her with a two-piece outfit surrounded by daisies. McCurdy throws on her best fake smile and exclaims it to be her favourite birthday gift ever. This particular event prods the readers to be cautious about the series of events that will unfold, hinting at the complex and often painful dynamics of her relationship with her mother that are to be revealed throughout the narrative. The general perception regarding abuse tends to focus primarily on physical violence overlooking other forms, such as emotional and psychological abuse. McCurdy, in her memoir, chronicles the continuum of emotional and psychological abuse she had to face throughout her childhood at the hands of her mother. Just like any other helicopter parent, McCurdy’s mother projects her unmet aspiration of becoming an actor to her daughter. She then continues to micromanage every aspect of McCurdy’s life, often pressuring her to achieve the dream that she once harboured. The authoritarian demeanour of the mother leaves McCurdy to develop OCD from a young age which she refers to as the “Holy Ghost”. Due to her age, she isn’t fully aware of how harmful the condition she was diagnosed with can be. Instead, she is thrilled to have conversations with the “Holy Ghost” where she says, “I can talk to the holy ghost whenever I want to, and he can talk to me, guiding me to do what is right, which is whatever he tells me to do. I am so lucky”. As the memoir continues, the readers find that the mother uses McCurdy’s fame to pay their bills, often flaunting her daughter’s success to maintain her unattained lifestyle. McCurdy’s struggle to make her mother understand her aspiration to become a writer instead of an actor is similar to the struggle of the character Farhan in the Bollywood hit ‘3 Idiots’, where, at last, the orthodox father finally lets his son pursue his interest of becoming a photographer. However, in McCurdy’s case, her mother is dismissive of her daughter’s ambition and instead tries to manipulate her daughter by saying, “Writer’s dress is frumpy and fat. I would never want your little actress’s peach butt to turn into a big, giant writer’s watermelon butt.” The emotional quandary of McCurdy’s is further complicated when her mother gets diagnosed with breast cancer. The mother’s manipulative behaviour leads her to make her children watch the video of her cancer diagnosis time and again until her children take it to blame themselves for the cause of their mother’s cancer. Ultimately, McCurdy considers it her job to save her mother from mortal sickness as cancer. She tries every rule in the book to get validation from her mother to the extent that she hides her preferred colour, purple, just because her mother prefers pink. The situation worsens when even after having reached the age of 16, the mother thinks it is a good idea to let her son and daughter shower in the same bathroom. Similarly, she puts McCurdy on a strict diet plan of calorie restriction. She is even made to read every diet-related book even before she gets her menstruation. The memoir is divided into two parts, i.e. before and after. ‘Before’ chronicles McCurdy’s experience with her abusive mother, whereas ‘After’ poignantly describes the harrowing effect of bulimia as a result of her mother’s years of abuse. The book also focuses on the ethical and developmental concerns of exposing a child to the limelight from a young age through McCurdy’s personal experience in the Hollywood industry. It also highlights the damage the entertainment industry can do to a child’s mental and emotional well-being. The book shines in its execution, particularly in addressing the question, “What does grief look like when you don’t share a great relationship with your loved one?” This question ties seamlessly into the title, as McCurdy struggles to recognise and cope with her emotions following her mother’s death. The universal practice of idolising one’s mother makes it difficult for her to acknowledge the abuse she endured during childhood—adding layers to her grief and healing process. Despite being a candid account of McCurdy’s experience with abuse, the nature of the memoir can resonate with Nepali readers. It mirrors the stark reality of Nepali households, where children often bear the burden of their parents’ unfulfilled dreams of securing a stable job. This restricts them from following their desire when it comes to careers. The memoir plays its part in demonstrating that fame is not everything; it is frequently nothing at all. It urges its readers to see the thin line that demarcates the life of an ordinary person and a celebrity. However, underneath the line lies a shared humanity that transcends fame and fortune, reminding us that our intrinsic value is not defined by external measures of success. The memoir should come with a trigger warning because its graphic narration of emotional abuse might make readers uncomfortable. This disrupted the linear flow of my reading experience, making it difficult to progress through the book. However, the author’s touch of sarcasm creates an engaging authorial voice. Destined to become an actor yet a natural when it comes to writing, McCurdy has set the train in motion through her candid yet moving writing. She accurately describes the mental state of her formative years, which skillfully captures the emotions she wishes to convey. The memoir ends on a hopeful note as McCurdy affirms, “Mom didn’t get better. But I will.” I’m Glad My Mom Died Author: Jennette McCurdy Year: 2022 Publisher: Simon and Schuster",https://kathmandupost.com/books/2024/06/15/a-candid-account-of-abuse-and-healing,books

It mirrors the stark reality of Nepali households, where children often bear the burden of their parents’ unfulfilled dreams of securing a stable job. This restricts them from following their desire when it comes to careers. The memoir plays its part in demonstrating that fame is not everything; it is frequently nothing at all. It urges its readers to see the thin line that demarcates the life of an ordinary person and a celebrity. However, underneath the line lies a shared humanity that transcends fame and fortune, reminding us that our intrinsic value is not defined by external measures of success. The memoir should come with a trigger warning because its graphic narration of emotional abuse might make readers uncomfortable. This disrupted the linear flow of my reading experience, making it difficult to progress through the book. However, the author’s touch of sarcasm creates an engaging authorial voice. Destined to become an actor yet a natural when it comes to writing, McCurdy has set the train in motion through her candid yet moving writing. She accurately describes the mental state of her formative years, which skillfully captures the emotions she wishes to convey. The memoir ends on a hopeful note as McCurdy affirms, “Mom didn’t get better. But I will.” I’m Glad My Mom Died Author: Jennette McCurdy Year: 2022 Publisher: Simon and Schuster",https://kathmandupost.com/books/2024/06/15/a-candid-account-of-abuse-and-healing,books

Their warning comes as the government plans to endorse the national budget on Thursday. The staff at the Parliament Secretariat claim that they have to work regularly before and after office hours without being paid a penny beyond their regular salary. “It has been three years since the government stopped paying the allowance,” Govind Belbase, chairperson of the Employee Union of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, told the Post. “We had to resort to protest as no money has been allocated in the budget for the upcoming fiscal year as well.” The national budget was tabled in Parliament on May 28, and the ministry-wise discussions are currently ongoing. The budget for the fiscal year 2024-2025 is scheduled to be endorsed on Thursday. Belbase said that the House meetings, which generally start at 11 am, run beyond 5 pm regularly. The staff must arrive at least an hour before the meeting for preparations and stay an additional hour after the meeting. House committee meetings are held at around 8 am, before Parliament meetings. “It is common for us to work 10-12 hours a day without any allowance,” Belbase said. He said it was injustice to them and against the ILO Convention of 1930, to which Nepal is a party. Article 3 of the Convention states, “The hours of work of persons to whom this Convention applies shall not exceed forty-eight hours in the week and eight hours in the day, except as hereinafter otherwise provided.” The allowance for government staff was withdrawn following the Covid-19 pandemic.

Heading not Found,Purushottam Poudel,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"What’s cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party? Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government? Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government. Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises. Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet. After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently. “We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post. Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam. “The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.” After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls. During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said. “However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.” Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K. The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television. “Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.” But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.”",https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2024/06/16/why-are-rsp-leaders-voicing-doubt-about-their-continuity-in-government,province-no-3

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli once again vented his ire at the budget for the new fiscal year on Saturday, fuelling speculations of growing discord among the ruling parties. On May 29, the day after Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun read out the national budget in Parliament, Oli lambasted some of the provisions and said the fiscal plan was of “one minister and one party”. Oli and his party were unhappy with some of the provisions, including the distribution of funds to the conflict victims, who mostly are CPN (Maoist Centre) members. Oli’s UML is the largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition government. Addressing the UML parliamentary party meeting on Saturday, Oli said the budget had failed to address the concerns of the poor. “Our duty is to stop poverty and lead the country towards development. If the poor are not benefitting and development is not happening, how can we satisfy them?” Oli wondered. He also asked the party’s ministers to see the status of the ministries they lead. “We have to keep track of the budget allocated to the ministries led by the UML,” Oli said, directing the party’s lawmakers to openly discuss the budget in the party and in Parliament. He also accused the government of failing to pay enough attention to development activities. “Our party joined the government to stop poverty and advance development. If that is not happening, how can we be satisfied?” Oli said. Stating that the percentage of the poor had now increased, Oli claimed that poverty had been reduced significantly during his premiership, which lasted over three years until July 2021. A UML central committee leader told the Post that Oli has already expressed his dissatisfaction with the budget with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Oli’s second instance of expressing his displeasure with the budget signals a growing misunderstanding between the two leaders, UML leaders said. Oli wants more spending in the sectors of entrepreneurship and infrastructure. He urged the UML ministers to study the budget but directed the party’s lawmakers not to comment on it on social media platforms. “It’d be better to express your concerns and comments at party meetings,” Oli told UML lawmakers. Also on Saturday, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the opposition Nepali Congress, raised questions about the government’s activities. The UML is in government, but the party is acting as if it is not a part of it, he said. “The UML first sent junior party leaders to the Cabinet. Now it has stopped owning up the government’s activities,” Thapa shared his observation. When the UML goes to people, it takes no responsibility for the government’s works, he said. “They are acting as though the UML was not consulted while the Maoists prepared the budget.” The party had deputed former finance minister Bishnu Poudel to provide inputs and suggestions for the budget.",https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2024/06/16/ruling-party-chief-oli-again-vents-ire-at-budget,province-no-3

Heading not Found,Post District Bureau,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"All seven provinces on Saturday unveiled their annual budgets for the upcoming fiscal year of 2024-25 beginning mid-July, mainly prioritising developing physical infrastructures, enhancing agricultural production and expanding the social safety net. The provincial executives presented budgets two weeks after the federal government unveiled the national budget for the next fiscal year of 2024-25. The local units will shortly present their respective annual budgets as per the legal provisions of the federal set-up. The Koshi provincial government led by CPN-UML leader Hikmat Kumar Karki presented a Rs35.27 billion budget in the provincial assembly. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Ram Bahadur Magar slashed the budget size by around Rs1 million compared with the current fiscal year. The budget has focused on agriculture, physical infrastructure, industry, service sector, education, health and tourism. Karki was also the chief minister when a Rs35.24 billion budget was presented last year in Koshi through ordinance as it was almost certain that the provincial assembly would not pass the policies and programmes as well as the budget. The Karki government was a minority government then. In Madhesh, a total budget of Rs43.89 billion has been presented during the provincial assembly meeting. Finance Minister Bharat Prasad Sah presented the budget for the next fiscal year allocating Rs16.7 billion current expenditure and Rs27.89 billion capital expenditure. The Madhesh government announced that the Nepali year of 2082 BS (2025-26) would be observed as a ‘tourism year’ in the province under the name of ‘Ghumau Madhesh, Bujhau Madhesh’—‘let’s tour and understand the Madhesh’. Meanwhile, the Bagmati province government unveiled a total budget of Rs64.54 billion, which is around Rs2 billion more that the budget of the current fiscal year. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Jagannath Thapaliya presented the budget allocating Rs26.10 billion under current expenditure and Rs36.93 billion under the capital expenditure. The Bagmati government prioritises education, health, agriculture and tourism in the new budget. In Gandaki, a total budget of Rs32.97 billion has been unveiled for the fiscal year 2024-25. The projected budget for the upcoming fiscal year is around Rs450 million less than the current fiscal year’s budget size.

While presenting the budget, Minister Gurung said that the provincial government would take around Rs1.70 billion internal loan if required. The Gandaki government also allocates Rs1.16 billion budgets of fiscal transfer to the local units under four different grants. Similarly, the Lumbini government unveiled a Rs38.97 billion budget—28 percent recurrent expenditure, 63 percent capital expenditure and approximately eight percent fiscal transfer—for the next fiscal year. Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Chet Narayan Acharya presented the budget at the province assembly meeting, laying focus on reviving an ailing economy. The budget aims to create employment and self-employment opportunities by prioritising the health, education, physical infrastructure, agriculture and tourism sectors. In Karnali, a total budget of Rs31.41 billion has been presented for the next fiscal year, down Rs2 billion from the current fiscal year.

Shortly after taking charge of the ministry, Shrestha started a process of taking action against the teachers and professors involved in party politics. The ministry has sought information on the teachers and professors affiliated to the parties from the Election Commission and the respective district education units. The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017 which prohibits the teachers, professors and other government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that school teachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from the state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics. The major parties have disapproved of Shrestha’s move as a large number of teachers are their cadres. For instance, as many as 263 of the 4,743 representatives to the Nepali Congress general convention held in December 2021 were school teachers and staff. The number is above five percent of the total delegates. The main opposition CPN-UML also had dozens of teachers as representatives in its 10th general congress held in November that year. Hundreds of school teachers are associated with the CPN (Maoist Centre) as well. Leaders from all these parties have criticised the move directly or indirectly. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel said the principals of many best-performing community schools were affiliated to different parties. “It is unnecessary to test teachers’ DNA. Let them work,” he said, implying that there was no need to probe whether the teachers are affiliated to a political party. Another factor antagonising the major parties is Shrestha’s decision to make public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission— more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli. On June 7, she made public the report that Oli and his successors had for years kept under wraps. The government was under the pressure of private schools to keep the report a secret as it envisions converting the schools registered as companies into trusts within 10 years. Converting the existing schools into trusts would mean they will be barred from taking profits home. Several cross-party leaders have investments in private schools. Oli was so annoyed by Minister Shrestha’s decision to make the report public that he resorted to making personal remarks about her nationality and marital status without naming her. Now the teachers’ unions of various parties have united against her. The ministry on May 27 endorsed a directive guiding teachers’ transfers. The directive came amid allegations that teachers are being transferred without fulfilling the due procedure. The directive is accused of encroaching on the authority of the School Management Committee and increasing the ministry’s role in transfers. “Your good education is meaningless if you are doing more harm than good to the education sector,” said Shankar Adhikari, chair of the teacher association close to the Maoist Centre, referring to Shrestha’s foreign degree. “She has a shallow understanding of Nepal's education sector.” Leaders of other teacher associations have asked the minister to reverse the directive, warning of the consequences of not doing so. “The directive was issued with the mala fide intent of troubling teachers. This is unacceptable,” said Gyanedra Rawal of the Nepal Teachers’ Union, the Congress teachers’ wing. Some lawmakers and education experts, however, have supported minister Shrestha, saying she is on the right track to improve the country's education sector. Addressing the lower house meeting on Wednesday, independent lawmaker Amresh Kumar Singh said he fully supports the education minister, who is making the necessary intervention. “The education minister is taking the right course. Her works need to be appreciated,” he said. Those who have followed Shrestha’s work also praise her. “She [Shrestha] is eager to bring about vital changes, mainly in school education,” said Usha Jha, a former member of the National Planning Commission. However, many officials at the ministry are unhappy with her work. While she is dedicated to her job, she has a habit of not listening to others, they allege. “The minister thinks she knows everything and is not accommodative.

Heading not Found,Purushottam Poudel,"June 10, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, is set for its Unity General Convention, which will commence on Monday in Janakpur, a month after the party suffered a split. The federal chair of the JSP-Nepal, Ashok Rai, along with seven federal lawmakers and 30 central committee members, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. The party split was more visible at the centre, but it is said to have had a lesser impact on Yadav’s faction in the province so far. Party insiders say the dissidents in provincial assemblies and party committees couldn’t get organised to form new committees as the registration of the new party at the election commission was immediately challenged in the Supreme Court. The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit. Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support. Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7. Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation. “The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.” Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari. “Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said. This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post. The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections. The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the part ies in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990. Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said. Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically. The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention. The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April. The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention. The party's foreign affairs department chief, Arjun Thapa, said delegates from India, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Indonesia have already arrived in Nepal. Invitations have been extended to various parties, except the Janata Samajbadi Party led by Ashok Rai, which splintered from the JSP-Nepal. The Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) are other parties that will participate in the Janakpur convention. Party leaders say the opening ceremony will be held on Monday, whereas the closed session, which will discuss the party’s political documents, is scheduled for the subsequent days.",https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/10/after-mergers-and-splits-upendra-yadav-goes-to-convention-to-cement-his-position,politics

Heading not Found,Purushottam Poudel,"June 9, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa has joined the group of leaders calling for a constitutional amendment in order to address the underperforming provincial system and the political instability allegedly caused by the mixed electoral system the country constitutionally endorsed nearly a decade ago. After a change in coalition at the centre began to affect provincial governments, voices for reforming the electoral system through constitutional amendment are growing louder. Speaking at a programme in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, a general secretary of the largest party in the House of Representatives, argued that reforming the electoral system had become necessary to ensure political stability. He also said that the provinces’ performance so far shows that the federal system cannot be sustained in its current form. “By reform in the provincial structure, I do not mean scrapping the federal system altogether, which the country cannot afford,” Thapa told the Post when asked to explain his statement. “The issue of governments’ formation in the provinces has been challenged in court. This is a result of lack of clarity on provincial government formation in the constitution.” The government formation process in Koshi and Gandaki provinces have been challenged multiple times, and the Supreme Court has many times invalidated the chief ministerial appointment and election processes in the two provinces. Questions have been raised over the expenditures for running the provincial governments. “To address this issue, we need to downsize the elected representatives’ bodies not only in the provinces but also at the federal level. For that, we need constitutional reform,” Thapa added. “We bear a collective responsibility to protect and sustain the constitution. This, however, requires some amendments. Reform in the electoral system is as important,” Thapa emphasised. The provinces followed the same process of government formation practised at the centre and that caused problems, he said. Thapa stressed that amendments to the constitution could address all these issues. The Congress leader says it is wrong to advocate either for scrapping the federal system altogether or and fully retaining the constitutional provisions on the provinces. The Rastriya Prajantara Party, which bats for the revival of the Hindu Kingdom, has been demanding the scrapping of the country’s federal structure. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which was formed two years ago, also wants the provincial structure overhauled. The new party says it wants to downsize the middle layer of the federal system. The party hasn’t participated in the provincial elections. Former National Assembly member Khim Lal Devkota, who is also an expert on federalism and a columnist at The Post, sees a slim chance of any changes in the federal system even though “it is necessary”. “I have closely worked with Nepal’s top political leaders. I believe they won’t readily amend the constitution,” Devkota told the Post. “The longer we take to amend the constitution, the more questions there will be on the longevity of the constitution.” During the Congress Mahasamiti meeting held in February, many leaders raised their voices in favour of filling all seats of the lower house of the federal parliament through direct election . Instead of electing a section of the lower house under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, the leaders had suggested that the upper house of the parliament be filled exclusively through the PR system. They were of the view that Nepal would not have a stable government unless all the lower house members were directly elected by their constituencies. Devkota is also of the opinion that Nepal needs to reform the election system. The mixed electoral system should be changed to create an environment for political instability, he said. In the 275-strong federal lower house, 165 are directly elected, whereas 110 come from the PR category. The upper chamber has 59 members. Of them, 56 are chosen through an electoral college comprising provincial assembly members and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units. Each province elects eight members, while three are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers. Likewise, among the 550 members in the seven provincial assemblies, 220 are elected under the PR category. This number is large compared to the population size and thus needs to be reduced significantly, say experts. However, Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, blames the political leaders for the current problems of the provinces. Top politicians are using provincial governments and assemblies to place their second- and third-tier leaders. This has burdened the state without yielding any tangible results, he added. Pokharel says this represents a failure of the leadership rather than the federal system. Since the inception of the provincial system, political parties have appointed chief ministers on a rotational basis, Pokharel told the Post. “It is true that there are operational problems in the provinces, but leaders are more responsible for this than the system.” Even though the state structure is federal, political parties have yet to adopt the three-tier system within their organisations, he said. “What stops the political parties from giving autonomy to their provincial committees and letting them make decisions regarding the provinces on their own?” Pokharel questioned. Devkota, however, said two models should be considered to ensure the stability of provincial governments. The first involves distributing the government leadership positions based on the number of seats won in the election, and the second concerns implementing provisions similar to those at the local government level. According to the first model, the chief minister and other positions are distributed based on the number of seats shared in the provincial assembly elections, and the government is run among the constituent parties on a consensus basis. As per the second method, the chief minister is directly elected by voters, similar to the election of mayors or chairs at the local units. This makes the chief ministers fully accountable to the people. The chief minister can be removed by a two-thirds majority of the provincial assembly, thus preventing one from being an autocrat. One of the major concerns is the destabilising linkage of provincial politics with the power equation in Kathmandu. When the coalition at the centre changes, governments in the provinces also change. The subnational governments changed immediately after the change in coalition partners in Kathmandu on March 4. When Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed ruling partners, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, CPN-UML, joined the government while the largest force, the Congress, was ousted from power. The changes at the centre immediately triggered changes in the provinces as well.",https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/09/politicians-experts-offer-ways-to-make-provinces-viable,politics

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 8, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology on Friday made public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Unveiling the report that Oli and his successors had kept under wraps was one of Sumana Shrestha's priorities as minister for education, science, and technology. Following her request, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal handed the report to the ministry on Monday. Shrestha consulted the commission members on Thursday. The ministry stated that the report’s recommendations will be implemented under Dahal’s leadership. The statement quoted Shrestha as saying, ""The government will implement positive and contextual suggestions."" In August 2018, the government formed a 25-member commission led by Education Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. It involved education experts, representatives from teachers’ and private schools’ associations, and officials in the task of recommending the government on its education policy. The commission prepared the report after rigorous discussions and consultations with the stakeholders. On January 15, 2019, it was submitted to Oli. However, Oli was not interested in implementing the recommendations, so he never made the report public. His successor, Sher Bahadur Deuba, also followed suit. The commission has recommended that private schools be converted into “trusts” within 10 years. This would, according to the commission, stop the commercialisation of education. Conversion into trust means that the school owners cannot distribute their profits. Currently, most of the private schools operate as companies after getting registered in the Company Registrar's Office. The commission, according to its members, made its recommendations based on Article 31(2) of the constitution, which makes the state responsible for ensuring compulsory basic and free secondary education for all. The commission said that leaving private educators to “generate profit”, as they are doing at present, would be tantamount to a breach of the constitution. The private school operators objected to the provision. They had tried to pressure the commission to exclude it as the report was being finalised. Usha Jha, a member of the commission, said there was immense pressure from the private schools to keep the report unpublished. ""We worked really hard to prepare the report. All the recommendations aim to improve the country's education system,"" Jha told the Post. ""The education minister took a bold step to make the report public. I believe it gets implemented. In fact, the minister is already following the spirit of the commission's report."" As the Oli government kept the report secret, a majority of members of the committee shared it with the media in December 2020. The National Campaign for Education, an umbrella body of over 400 organisations working in the education sector, had printed the report and distributed it at an event. However, the report coming out of the ministry holds a different meaning—that the government owns it, said Jha. The commission recommended that the government facilitate private sector investment in higher education and bring school education gradually under the government’s ambit. It also suggested partnerships between private and public schools to improve the latter’s quality. Hiring head teachers on contract after evaluating their performance, increasing education budget to at least 20 percent of the government’s spending as per its commitment and ensuring that every child gets basic education in his/her mother tongue are other major recommendations of the commission. Despite Nepal’s global commitment, the proportion of the national budget allocated to the education sector has been declining. The share of the education budget, which once amounted to 17 percent, is now down to 11 percent. Allocating at least 20 percent of the national budget, or 6.5 percent of the national GDP, to education is considered the global norm. Several commissions have been formed to recommend educational reforms over the past decades. However, most of the reports remain unimplemented. The Pokharel-led commission was the sixth formed since 1955 and third after the restoration of democracy in 1950 to look into matters concerning education.",https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/08/education-commission-report-kept-secret-by-oli-government-made-public,politics

Heading not Found,Anil Giri,"June 7, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The caretaker Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is all set to take the oath of office for the third constitutive term on Sunday evening, with the invited South Asian leaders to witness the ceremony. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials. Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance. With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade. “India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy. In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences. This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment. “Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement. The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.” Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement. Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them. Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance. Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio. The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA). According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped. “If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak.",https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2024/06/07/modi-3-0-all-eyes-on-india-s-nepal-peripheral-policies,politics

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 7, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Days after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government. “Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.” The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site. The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media. In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah. Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions. “The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way. Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.” As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli. Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue. A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public. Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said.",https://kathmandupost.com/kathmandu/2024/06/07/congress-backs-kathmandu-mayor-s-new-road-sidewalk-expansion-bid,kathmandu

Heading not Found,Arjun Poudel,"June 6, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"With the monsoon just around the corner, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has finally started repairing the Sisdole road that leads to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district. Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday. “We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.” Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city. “We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.” The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised. Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal. KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control. Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally. Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households. Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process. Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part. The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled.",https://kathmandupost.com/kathmandu/2024/06/06/as-monsoon-nears-kmc-starts-repairing-road-to-bancharedanda-landfill-site,kathmandu

The fourth Nepal Living Standard Survey report, published by the National Statistics Office on Thursday, shows that the unemployment rate climbed up to 12.6 percent in 2022-23 from 11.4 percent in 2017-18, representing a 1.2 percent rise in the five-year period.

The survey report shows joblessness among people between the ages of 15 and 24 declined to 22.7 percent in 2022-23 from 23.9 percent in 2017-18. “Most worrying is the rise in unemployment in the past five years, which increased by 1.2 percent, and that’s worrisome,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the statistics office. “The economy has failed to generate enough jobs for its large and expanding young population.” The population structure has shifted towards a younger working-age population, with a decrease in the proportion of children (0-14 years) and an increase in the proportion of adults (15-59 years). This trend is further supported by a declining dependency ratio, suggesting a growing workforce. The proportion of the elderly population (60 years and above) has increased. Regmi said the age between 15 and 24, the most productive time for an individual, is not considered the working age in Nepal, as these people are involved in education and training. “At this age, our survey has found, people will work only if they are offered a job. The responsibility to earn money grows in later years.” The survey data on employment status reveals significant shifts in the labour market between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of those with jobs has declined considerably from 67.2 percent in 1995-96 to 32.4 percent in 2022-23, while the percentage of those not in the labour force has increased from 29.4 percent to 62.9 percent. The share of wage employment in agriculture has significantly declined from 70.7 percent in 1995-96 to 1.9 percent in 2022-23. The share of wage employment in non-agriculture, on the other hand, has risen considerably from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 56.6 percent in 2022-23. The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed. The labour force participation rate came down to 37.1 percent in 2022-23 from 38.2 percent five years ago. “The employment condition in Nepal is the worst,” said economist Pushkar Bajracharya. “The government failed to create jobs. This is because the investment environment has not been favourable in past years, mainly due to political and policy uncertainty. When there is no investment, there is no job creation.” Bajracharya said the unemployment rate would further jump due to the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the recession and slowdown the country has seen. “Many industries, service sectors and companies are still laying off workers due to the economic slowdown. There is low demand for labour in the country as the key economic sectors—construction and manufacturing—are facing recession, while wholesale and retail have shown a slight recovery,” said Bajracharya. The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed. Post File Photo Experts say that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the jobs being created in Nepal’s economy are not of quality. There is a need for new strategies, new partners, and new goals. Each year, around a million Nepali youths, including students, leave the country to try their luck abroad. The survey data on remittances and transfers reveals a significant increase in the prevalence and magnitude of remittances received by households in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of households receiving remittances has increased dramatically from 23.4 percent in 1995-96 to 76.8 percent in 2022-23, indicating a significant rise in the number of Nepali families relying on the money sent by their members working abroad. This increase is consistent with the observed growth in average remittances per household, which has significantly increased from Rs15,160 in 1995-96 to Rs145,093 in 2022-23. Remittances (other than from India) are quite dominant, highlighting the importance of international migration for income generation. Remittances from India declined from 32.9 percent in 1995-96 to 11.1 percent in 2010-11, but they have increased since, reaching 21.3 percent in 2022-23, according to the survey report. The survey data on household loans shows that the percentage of families borrowing money is relatively stable (61.3 percent in 1995-96 and 63.8 percent in 2022-23). However, the percentage of households with outstanding loans has significantly increased, from 58.4 percent in 1995-96 to 97.3 percent in 2022-23. The data also reveals a shift in the sources of household loans. Traditional money lenders were previously a dominant source (39.7 percent in 1995-96), but their share significantly decreased to 11.4 percent in 2022-23. The share of loans from banks has increased (from 16.1 percent in 1995-96 to 22.4 percent in 2022-23), while loans from relatives continue to remain significant (40.8 percent in 1995-96 to 42.5 percent in 2022-23). Household consumption as a reason for borrowing has been declining (from 49.4 percent in 1995-96 to 23.5 percent in 2022-23). This could be attributed to improved access to essential goods and services or a shift to other borrowing needs, the survey report shows. The use of collateral has also shifted, with an increase in the proportion of loans taken with collateral. While 16.8 percent of loans were taken with land and house collateral in 1995-96, this share increased to 35.1 percent in 2022-23. The data shows a noticeable shift in the dominant sectors of non-farm activities. While trade was previously the most prevalent sector (52.1 percent in 1995-96), it has declined (42.5 percent in 2022-23). The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23. Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support. Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72. Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent. According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23. Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867. The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income. The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23. The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population. This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23. The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23. This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23. The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases. There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices. A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices. Cold/fever remains a significant concern, increasing from 43.7 percent in 1995-96 to 51.5 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of those consulting a doctor has remained relatively stable (around 29 percent), and the percentage consulting a paramedic has significantly decreased. Migration patterns within Nepal reveal significant shifts in trends between 2003-04 and 2022-23. While the overall percentage of the migrant population within the country has remained relatively stable—36.6 percent in 2003-04 and 38.1 percent in 2022-23—there is a notable shift in the gender composition of migrants. Males constituted a higher proportion of migrants in 2003-04 (50.1 percent), but females made a larger share of the migrant population (49.6 percent) in 2022-23. A decline in the percentage of migrants from rural areas in 2022-23 indicates a potential shift in migration patterns, possibly driven by changing economic opportunities and societal factors. The analysis of reasons for migration reveals that family remains the dominant factor (75.2 percent in 2003-04 moving within the country for family reasons and 74.9 percent in 2022-23). The fourth Nepal Living Standards Survey, conducted in 2022-23, is the first such survey since the country’s transition to a federal system. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 9,600 households on a wide range of topics.",https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/16/nepal-s-unemployment-rate-rises-to-12-6-percent-survey-says,money

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal’s unemployment rate has been increasing, according to a report. The fourth Nepal Living Standard Survey report, published by the National Statistics Office on Thursday, shows that the unemployment rate climbed up to 12.6 percent in 2022-23 from 11.4 percent in 2017-18, representing a 1.2 percent rise in the five-year period. The unemployment rate has risen from 4.9 percent in 1995-96 to 12.6 percent in 2022-23.

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The Millennium Challenge Account Nepal (MCA-Nepal) has awarded and signed a contract with Techno Electric and Engineering Company Ltd. India to construct a 400 kV substation at Ratmate in Belkotgadhi Municipality-7 of Nuwakot district as part of implementing Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact. ""The 400 kV Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) substation will be constructed within the contract duration of 39 months,"" The MCA-Nepal said in a statement on Saturday. ""Once completed, Ratmate Substation will have a capacity of 1000 Mega Volt Ampere making it one of the largest substations in the country."" The new US$ 51.6 million Ratmate Substation will serve as a critical interconnection of power transmission between the Lapsiphedi and New Hetauda Substations, the MCA-Nepal said. Khadga Bahadur Bisht, executive director at the MCA-Nepal, and Rajiv Agarwal, director- commercial at Techno Electric and Engineering Company Ltd. India signed and exchanged the contract in the presence of MCC and MCA-Nepal officials. With the execution of this contract, MCA-Nepal has signed two of the three substations construction contracts planned under the MCC Nepal Compact. Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Managing Director Kulman Ghising has described the signing of the deal as an important progress in implementing the MCC Compact. “The 400 kV Ratmate Substation, as envisioned in the Transmission System Development Plan of Nepal (TSDPN), is a critical component of Nepal's national power transmission system and yet another milestone in MCC Nepal Compact’s contribution to the energy sector in Nepal,” he said. Diane L Francisco, resident country director, Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), said the signing of the Ratmate Substation, the second of the three substations marks a significant stride forward as the MCC Nepal Compact builds momentum in its implementation. ""Over the next few years, we are confident that the progress of the MCC Nepal Compact will provide critical contributions to Nepal’s growing energy sector, helping meet Nepal’s evolving needs, bolstering Nepal’s immense potential, and bringing prosperity to the Nepali people,” Francisco said. Photo: Courtesy of MCA-Nepal MCA-Nepal Executive Director Bisht shared that the MCA-Nepal is expediting all works for the construction of the substations and transmission lines under the Electricity Transmission Project funded by the US government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the government of Nepal. ""The contract for the third substation in Damauli is in the pipeline and the bids for the 18-km cross-border line are under evaluation,"" he said. ""We are also at the final stages of the procurement process to invite bids for the construction of the remaining portion of the transmission line as well.” The 400kV Ratmate Substation will also have evacuation capacity of around 3,200 MW of power from hydropower projects and substations. The reliable power at various voltage levels at the substation will be available for distribution in Nepal to enhance industrial and commercial activities, the MCA-Nepal said. Along with three substations, the MCC Nepal Compact will fund the construction of up to 315 km of transmission line from Lapsiphedi, Kathmandu to the Nepal-India border in Nawalparasi (Bardaghat Susta West) under the Electricity Transmission Project. The bids for the 18 km cross-border transmission line have been received for evaluation and that it aims to award the contract in August, said the MCA-Nepal. ""Likewise, preparations are on track to ensure the bids for the remaining 297 km of transmission lines are relaunched at the earliest possible this year,"" it said.",https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/15/mca-nepal-signs-second-400kv-substation-construction-contract,money

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Thailand is on the brink of becoming the ultimate destination for the LGBTQIA+ community, thanks to its welcoming environment and the recent launch of the Pink Plus Economy initiative. This revolutionary move, announced on June 9 by Borderless.lgbt, aims to create a supportive ecosystem for LGBTQIA+ individuals in Thailand, encompassing living, family planning, and retirement. According to the reports, Thailand Privilege, a state-owned enterprise dedicated to long-term visas, backs the initiative. The support for the Pink Plus Economy is bolstered by Thailand’s National Legislative Assembly’s recent legalisation of same-sex marriage and upcoming policies favouring LGBTQIA+ family planning. If the legislation is approved by the Senate, Thailand will join Taiwan and Nepal as the only Asian nations to permit same-sex marriage. According to the report, Thailand is ready to welcome more than 200 million LGBTQIA individuals from around the world to wed, live, play, innovate, plan a family and retire in the country. Borderless.lgbt, supported by Thailand Privilege, will offer a series of ""Pink Plus"" membership packages with multi-merchant offerings, including a Thailand Privilege card, a state-of-the-art immersive telemedicine platform with renowned medical experts, shopping vouchers, retirement living programmes and pink tech innovation workshops. Other facilities are family wellness support, dedicated financial planning services, home buying/leasing support and exclusive resort staycations, which will be rolled out for distribution via global resellers. “We are very excited to be part of the journey of how Thailand transforms itself to be a global Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DE&I) hub.

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The 21st replenishment meeting of the International Development Association (IDA21) is scheduled to be held in Kathmandu on June 18. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will deliver a keynote address at the opening session of the four-day meeting. The session will be led by the co-chairs of the IDA21 replenishment—World Bank Senior Managing Director Axel van Trotsenburg and Sheku Sambadeen Sesay, the IDA21 Independent Co-Chair. Faris Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank country director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, said the major event, to be held in Kathmandu for the first time, will bring more than 200 IDA delegates representing both donors and recipients. IDA is the part of the World Bank that invests in the future of people and the planet, with projects across 75 countries. Established in 1960, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing grants and zero- to low-interest loans for programmes that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions. Replenishing IDA’s resources will be a key topic of the meeting, which comes at the midpoint of a funding cycle concluding in December 2024—when donors commit to contributions for July 2025 to June 2028. The June 18 session kicks off four days of closed-door meetings to discuss IDA21’s proposed focus areas, assess the financing needs of countries supported by IDA, and consider financing scenarios. The overarching theme for IDA21 is ‘ending poverty on a livable planet: delivering impact with urgency and ambition’. To fulfil this, the IDA21 policy package will have five focus areas: people, planet, prosperity, infrastructure and digitalisation, supported by four lenses of gender, jobs, fragility, conflict and violence, and private investments. The current replenishment (IDA20) ends on June 30, 2025. The target, or a narrow range of scenarios, for the pledging session, is typically agreed upon at the fourth replenishment meeting in October. IDA21 resources will be available for commitments for a three-year period starting July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2028. IDA will continue to provide special support for countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence and utilise windows to provide additional resources specific to key thematic priorities, such as crisis response, addressing regional challenges, and providing blended finance for private sector investments in IDA countries, among others. “IDA is scaling up its market share significantly, also enabling co-financing and coordinating donor resources to maximise impact. IDA is a transparent, accountable, and cost-effective platform that delivers results, making it a prime investment for global development finance. So you can get a sense of how important this meeting is,” said Hadad-Zervos. He said that Nepal's development story is original. “It is one of economic transformation in the face of various challenges. It faced almost every challenge that a country could face—conflict, earthquakes, Covid, climate crisis, floods, and many others.” “This confluence has put Nepal's development gains at risk. Yet Nepal is a very resilient country. And despite these challenges, it has achieved significant development progress,” he said. Shree Krishna Nepal, joint-secretary at the finance ministry, said that the World Bank Group’s first economic mission to Nepal was in 1963 to assess the country's developing prospects and challenges. The group approved its first credit in 1969 for a telecommunications project that continues to be transformative today. Since then, IDA has provided Nepal with $6 billion in credits and grants. Currently, the World Bank is supporting 24 projects worth $2.3 billion. The World Bank said IDA is also helping transform the lives of millions of Nepalis through investments in education, health, jobs and skills, connectivity and infrastructure, social protection, food security, and others. A robust IDA 21 replenishment will ensure that IDA countries continue to benefit from it and that IDA continues its decades-long track record of lifting millions of people out of poverty, providing quality education for children, ensuring access to health services, and creating jobs so that people in low-income countries can become self-sustainable and living, according to the multilateral funding agency.",https://kathmandupost.com/money/2024/06/15/world-bank-s-ida21-comes-to-nepal,money

According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, which issued a special bulletin, several districts of eastern Nepal—Sankhuwasabha, Taplejung, Panchthar, Ilam and Jhapa districts have been witnessing rainfall caused by the monsoon clouds. “This year, monsoon clouds entered the country three days before the normal onset date,” said Sanjeev Adhikari, a meteorologist at the division. “But people residing in the Tarai region of mid- and far-western Nepal should not expect immediate relief from the heatwave conditions, as it normally takes at least a week for the clouds to reach the far-western region.” Dhangadhi recorded 44 degree Celsius on Monday, followed by Nepalgunj 43.6, Birendranagar 40.9, Bhairahawa 39.8, Ghorahi 39.6 and Dipayal 40.7 degree Celsius. Kathmandu recorded 34.4 degree Celsius, according to the met office. Met officials said that monsoon clouds could bring rainfall to the Kathmandu Valley on Wednesday. They said the western wind is still blowing in the mid and western parts of the country. The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. Last year, it started on June 14, one day later than the normal onset day. A normal monsoon, supported by the timely arrival of rain, translates into favourable agricultural production, mainly of paddy, and is further linked with the country’s overall economic growth. The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw. The Met Office has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events, such as flooding, inundation, and landslides. The department’s climate section has forecast weather conditions for four months (June to September). It said most parts of the country are likely to experience above-average minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall due to weakened El Nino conditions, and the development of La Nina conditions. El Nino conditions are the climatic patterns in which the surface water warms, unusually. The opposite, the cooling of the ocean surface, happens in the La Nina conditions. “There is a 35 to 55 percent chance of above-average rainfall in most parts of the country during monsoon,” reads the bulletin issued by the department. “Chance of above-average maximum and minimum temperature in most parts of the country is 35 to 65 percent.” The weather forecast predicts a 35-45 percent chance of normal rainfall in a few places of Lumbini and Sudurpaschim provinces. Similarly, central parts of Gandaki province and southern parts of Koshi province may experience normal maximum temperatures, and its chances are also 35 to 45 percent. Also, the chances of normal minimum temperatures in a few places in Sudurpaschim, Gandaki and Bagmati Province is 35 to 45 percent, according to the Met Department. Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half. Evidence suggests the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average of a rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short time, continuous rain for several days post-monsoon, dry spells and droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal temperatures in winter—have become more frequent in Nepal. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by the monsoon this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly affected, and 18,000 families will need to be rescued in monsoon-related disasters. Experts from the authority say that most districts in the Tarai could be affected by flooding this rainy season. The vulnerable places include Rapti-Sonari Rural Municipality of Banke, Bardiya, Tikapur of Kailali, Triveni-Susta Rural Municipality of Nawalparasi West, Kalahari Rural Municipality of Morang, and several places of Rautahat. Several locations in West Rukum; Jajarkot; Helambu and Melamchi of Sindhupalchok; Sangurigadhi Rural Municipality of Dhankuta; Maiwakhola Rural Municipality of Taplejung; and Chumnubri of Gorkha have been designated as most vulnerable to landslides during the monsoon. Monsoon in Nepal is a season of epidemics, with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases. Snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common in the season but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. Scores die, and thousands of people get infected with the dengue virus every monsoon. Most sources of drinking water generally become contaminated during the rainy season. People residing in disaster-hit areas, and those displaced by natural disasters are highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Officials at the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority said they have started preparations accordingly to deal with possible incidents of disasters in the coming days. The authority has formulated the ‘Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan-2081’ to deal with disaster incidents. Agencies under the ministries including the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Health and Population, Ministry of Urban Development, and the Ministry of Water Supply have crucial roles in disaster response. The UN agencies also play a major role by providing aid, according to Dijan Bhattarai, spokesperson for the authority. “Logistics and relief materials have already been stocked up in the warehouses of all seven provinces and 12 logistics hubs,” he said. Officials say all agencies, including the Army, Police, Armed Police Force, non-governmental organisations, and agencies under ministries, have their own responsibility and they should act proactively during disasters.",https://kathmandupost.com/climate-environment/2024/06/10/monsoon-enters-nepal-three-days-ahead-of-schedule,climate-environment

Heading not Found,Basant Pratap Singh,"June 5, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nisha Tulachan, an 18-year-old woman from Mustang’s Naurikot, died in her sleep. Her house made up of mud collapsed on her on the night of July 26, 2020 and she died on the spot. Her 70-year-old grandfather was seriously injured. Tulachan’s uncle Shukra Gauchan said that it had been raining for two days before the night of the incident, and their traditional house made of wood, hay, stones, and mud gave in. “There are 28 houses in Naurikot, all built in the traditional style as ours. Rains are unusual in the mountains, so the whole village was shocked,” said Gauchan. Residents of Naurikot who were living in houses with traditional mud roofs, started demolishing and building concrete houses after the incident. Naurikot village lies at an altitude of 2,740 metres in ward 2 of Thasang Rural Municipality, in Mustang. “In the mountain region, traditional mud houses are the best for staying warm, but when rains started becoming more frequent, everybody got scared. People from several other wards of the rural municipality also started building new houses by demolishing the old ones,” Gauchan added. Lo Manthang, which lies at an altitude of 3,840 meters above sea level, is the northernmost settlement in Mustang. The residents of Lo Manthang are also building concrete houses by demolishing traditional mud houses. Prem Hinjing Gurung, a 66-year-old man from Lo Manthang in ward 5 of Lo Manthang Rural Municipality, said that more than 25 houses in the village have been built with concrete now. “Those who could afford, built new concrete houses, and a few families migrated elsewhere,” said Gurung. The statistics of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) also show that heavy rains in Mustang district have started causing extensive damage. According to the NDRRMA website, two houses were completely destroyed due to the heavy rains in the fiscal year 2017-2018, and property worth Rs15.6 million was lost. In 2005, climate change and environment expert Ngamindra Dahal wrote in the Tiempo magazine of the University of East Anglia in the UK that the livelihoods of the locals were being affected when abnormal rains started in the high Himalayan regions like Mustang. Later in 2011, Dahal started further research on climate change in the mountain region. The residents of Mustang and Manang districts told him that their areas were seeing abnormal climate patterns—unexpected rains in summer and less snow in winter. Some locals told Dahal that losing traditional houses also meant losing culture and tradition. Dahal said that due to climate change, monsoon rain, which is generally limited from 2,500-3,000 meters above sea level, is now affecting Mustang and Manang, which are above 3,500 meters. “South Asian monsoons do not go higher than 2,500 to 3,000 meters, but the monsoon has moved up to 4,000 meters in just the last two or three decades,” said Dahal. The geography of Mustang and Manang are very different and sensitive. In the mountain region, where there would be no rainfall, people grew crops using the melted snow. The mountain districts across the Himalayas, which had different seasonal cycles, have now become a monsoon region, Dahal further added. According to a journal article published by Dahal in 2022, the average annual temperature in lower Mustang has increased by 0.021 degrees Celsius per year, and the average annual rainfall has increased by 1.83 millimeters per year in the last 45 years. The data provided in the journal was similar to the temperature and rainfall data recorded at meteorological stations in the lower Mustang region from 1973 to 2018. According to the NDRRMA, there have been five instances of heavy rains and avalanches in Mustang and Manang since the fiscal year 2014-2015. Similarly, the two districts saw 32 landslides and 19 incidents of flooding since then. In Mustang alone, 31 houses were completely destroyed by floods in four places in the last monsoon season. Similarly, 16 houses were partially damaged, and more than 35 families were affected. The floods on May 28, 2021, and June 15, 2021, damaged property worth Rs3 billion, destroying houses, bridges, schools, and roads, among other infrastructures, in Nason, Chame, and Manang Nesyang rural municipalities of Manang district. According to the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, the rainfall measurement station at Humde in Manang recorded 82.2 mm of rain on June 15, 2021. In Humde, the average rainfall in June 2015 was 42 mm, but in June 2021, the area saw 197 mm of rainfall in a period of 15 days. This was 469 percent more than that of June 2015 average. In May 2021, the area recorded 693 percent more rain compared to the same period in 2015. The change in the timing of seasonal rainfall has also impacted agriculture in mountain districts. Farmers in high altitude areas are facing challenges in protecting their crops—they grow mainly potato, wheat, barley and buckwheat—as the temperature increases and the pattern of rain changes. Aaita Bahadur Thakali, a local farmer from ward 5 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality, Mustang, reported a decline in crop yields. According to Karma Gurung from Dhumba in Gharpajhong Rural Municipality, Mustang, who has been involved in commercial cultivation of apples for decades, the district produced 5,464 metric tons of apples on 520 hectares in the fiscal year 2021-2022. Although the apple growing area has expanded to 1,400 hectares, the total production was only 6,250 metric tons in the fiscal year 2023-24. Madan Regmi, head of the Agriculture Knowledge Centre in Manang, said that on April 26, it snowed in upper Manang damaging the apple flowers. Also, the activity of helpful insects in pollination (bees and bumblebees) was subdued as the temperature was below the freezing point. “Unexpected weather events, which have become more frequent, during the main season, have hit crop yields badly,” said Regmi. “Not just apples, but vegetable production has also been affected—by the cold. The lower areas of Manang that used to receive monsoon rains, have been seeing dry monsoons for the past few years. The earlier rain shadow region in the highlands, have been seeing heavy rainfall during the monsoon for the past few years. These unexpected shifts in rain patterns have hit farmers the most,” Regmi added. Locals say a pine species locally called Sang tree found in the upper Mustang region and used for worship and other rituals, are also disappearing due to climate change. According to a report published by the National Statistics Office, 47.1 percent of the families in the Himalayan region of Gandaki Province participating in the survey said that they have felt the effects of climate change in the last 25 years. In the Gandaki province, 39.5 percent of families said that new diseases and insects have appeared in crops over the past 25 years. Similarly, 97.4 percent families in Gandaki are not aware of the early warning of climate disasters, according to the office’s survey. The chief district officer of Mustang, Janakraj Panta, who is also the chairman of the District Disaster Management Committee, said that the local governments are working on climate adaptation and risk reduction to the best of their abilities, but these efforts are not enough. “The situation has gone beyond the control of the local government and the district authorities. The provincial and federal governments are also aware of the climate-induced disasters, but have not been taking mitigation measures,” said Pant. “The more the delay in implementing long-term programmes, the more the likelihood of further damage,” Pant added. Environment expert Dahal said the federal and provincial governments should take the initiative to implement long-term climate adaptation and disaster mitigation measures.",https://kathmandupost.com/climate-environment/2024/06/05/climate-change-hits-mountain-people-on-multiple-fronts,climate-environment

The Covax facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has agreed to provide 100,000 doses of the children’s vaccine, and supply will start in the last week of June, according to officials at the Ministry of Health and Population. “These 100,000 doses are part of the 2.5 million doses, which Covax had agreed to supply to Nepal in 2024,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Children between five and 11 having underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.” Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months. Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe. The Covax facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine, which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population. Officials said that Nepal will receive 1.6 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccine by the end of this month, including the children’s vaccine, from Covax. The rest of the doses of the monovalent vaccine to be received later will be administered to the adult population in all provinces of the country. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2. Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid. The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components: the original virus strain and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants. Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic.",https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/06/15/100-000-immunocompromised-children-aged-5-11-years-to-receive-covid-vaccine,health

Heading not Found,Arjun Poudel,"June 8, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"At least one case of cholera, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, has been confirmed in Kathmandu. According to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, a 62-year-old man from Makwanpur district, who had been admitted with severe diarrhoea some two weeks ago, tested positive for the deadly disease. The man is said to have been residing in Kathmandu for a long time. “The health condition of the patient was serious when he was brought to our hospital,” said a health worker serving at the Hospital’s Emergency Department, asking not to be named, as the official was not authorised to speak to the media. “The stool test confirmed a cholera infection.” According to health workers at the hospital, Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in stool samples of infected patients. Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development. The Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak in the monsoon of 2022 in which 77 cholera-positive cases were confirmed. Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months. Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.” Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.” Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago. An Indian national who is a truck driver was admitted to the Sukraraj Hospital at that time. “We had mobilised our team to investigate the source of the outbreak,” said Sapkota. Doctors warn that concealing outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and failing to investigate their sources and inform the public about the risks can prove counterproductive, as the deadly bacteria keep spreading in communities if preventative measures are not taken. Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected with them every year. Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main catalysts for the spread of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City that were highly affected by the outbreak. In October 2021, a Vibrio cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu district killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man. Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts failed to curb the infection. The World Health Organisation says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera. A combination of careful survey, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors.",https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/06/08/cholera-outbreak-in-kathmandu-authorities-unaware,health

Heading not Found,Arjun Poudel,"June 8, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Post-monsoon is considered the dengue epidemic season. However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon. Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks. “Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.” Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period. Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever. In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time. Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus. Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. “Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.” Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said. Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.",https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/06/08/most-districts-report-dengue-outbreaks,health

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 5, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Severe heat in the Tarai region has affected ongoing polio vaccination programmes. Officials at the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services say the immunisation campaign has been affected by school closures due to scorching heat. “The immunisation campaign will resume once schools resume their regular classes,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “It will take more time for the campaign to complete due to the severe heat in Tarai districts.” Several districts’ maximum temperatures have either reached close to or crossed 40 degrees Celsius in the last few days. On Tuesday, Dhangadhi recorded 40.4 degrees Celsius, Nepalgunj 40.2 degrees Celsius and Birendranagar 37.3 degrees Celsius, the Met office’s data shows. Met officials anticipate monsoon will start at the end of next week and bring respite from scorching heat. Over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 are being inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a nationwide immunisation drive started on May 26. Officials said that children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio. Gautam said that vaccination programmes are being carried out smoothly in the rest of the places. The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts. Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years. After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis. Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme. IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types. Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine. “Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.” Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity. Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost. Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that. The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 , carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016. The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country.",https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/06/05/heatwave-condition-affects-polio-vaccination-in-tarai,health

Heading not Found,Arjun Poudel,"June 3, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates. “Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.” A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 , carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population. The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030. The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets. Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services. “Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.” The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births. “Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.” Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life. Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals. Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit. The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there. Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring. Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say. Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.”",https://kathmandupost.com/health/2024/06/03/nepal-aims-to-reduce-neonatal-deaths-to-13-but-experts-sceptical-about-the-goal-s-success,health

Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad. In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray , Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish. How did your cooking journey start in New York? At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering. But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision. What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age? As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating. Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs. I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered. How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate? The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking. During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community. We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food. ‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian.

Photo: Courtesy of The Sewing Tin NYC How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin? My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage. We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila , similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland. What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad? I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere. How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal? The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times. Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community. I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences. The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity. What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider? Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you. Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion. What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles? Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful. Mishra’s signature dish: Confit Duck Chatamari Mishra’s signature dish, Confit Duck Chatamari.

Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful. Mishra’s signature dish: Confit Duck Chatamari Mishra’s signature dish, Confit Duck Chatamari.

Heading not Found,Post Report,"January 27, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Potato, a staple food of hundreds of thousands of people, especially those residing in the mountainous regions, is among the most widely consumed and versatile crops in Nepal. The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important. Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health. Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes. Sourcing of potatoes Potatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region. Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion. “These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme. As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoes Red and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity. “Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.” Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health. Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health. Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french fries Of late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food. Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain. “Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.” Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar.",https://kathmandupost.com/food/2024/01/27/know-your-food-potato,food

Heading not Found,Post Report,"January 13, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Chicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal. According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections. Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day. “Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association. Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc. “A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.” What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs. Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs. The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells. Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say. Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development.",https://kathmandupost.com/food/2024/01/13/know-your-food-eggs,food

Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son. This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me. The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered. Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories. My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good. A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Photo: Courtesy of Deepak Adhikari Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories. We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya). Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future. My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community. As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution.",https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/11/18/old-memories-and-new-realities-in-phidim,travel

During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more. In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘ Imambara ’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. Rumi Darwaza, the portal to Bara Imambara. Anish Ghimire/TKP To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque , recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls. Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past. This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. Asafi Mosque situated inside the complex of Bara Imambara. Anish Ghimire/TKP After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born . It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide. As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery. The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.” Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. Underground stepwell known as Shahi Baoli. Anish Ghimire/TKP After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art. The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara. Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Walls of Asafi hall. Anish Ghimire/TKP Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building. I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure. My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time.

Heading not Found,Manushree Mahat,"October 14, 2023",Kathmandu-Post,"Serene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy. For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials. Meet Luckme Syangden , a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process. Preparation for the journey Trekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. Luckme Syangden Courtesy of Pasang Rinzee Sherpa “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden. Manu Rai , 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek. For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Manu Rai Courtesy of Sangpo Lama Backpacking essentials When backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers. Managing periods during treks Managing periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden. Handling altitude sickness and injuries Rai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Travel essentials of Manu Rai Courtesy of Manu Rai Effective communication with trekkers and guides Syangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek. “In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states. Challenges faced by a female trekkers Both Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Courtesy of Pasang Rinzee Sherpa Becoming a trekking guide Trekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge. Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides.",https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/10/14/of-treks-and-trails,travel

Heading not Found,Rukusha Giri,"June 17, 2023",Kathmandu-Post,"Five young female travellers, Binita Jirel , Menuka Gurung , Juliana Shrestha , Rejina Tamang , and Shanti Rai , noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021. The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post . Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling. An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days. What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal? It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu. As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Photo: Courtesy of Duluwa Outdoors Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa. Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices. What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone? Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities. It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents. Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off. What are some travel safety tips you swear by? Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone. If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning. Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course. Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry.",https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2023/06/17/travelling-nepal-solo,travel

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 6, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Scientists from Australia, Italy, and Nepal have teamed up with the Nepal government and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to deliver a new state-of-the-art artificial intelligence system that can analyse the significant amount of data needed to identify when the rain-soaked ground is about to give way. The forecasting system, called SAFE-RISCCS, continuously analyses satellite images of Earth taken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Feeding SAFE-RISCCS forecasts into Landslide Early Warning Systems will protect people living in the shadow of landslides, ensuring far more accurate alerts days or even weeks in advance. University of Melbourne scientist Professor Antoinette Tordesillas, who is leading the project, said about 59 per cent of Nepal was prone to landslides and had one of the world’s highest deaths per capita due to landslides. “More than 80 per cent of the land in Nepal is on a slope, and much of the country was destabilised during the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. With the monsoons due in June, we are helping policymakers and risk managers better prepare for future monsoons when increasingly frequent and heavy rains are expected to trigger more devastating landslides,” said Professor Tordesillas. “Climate change and growing human activities pose a significant threat to communities in Nepal.” Women, children, the elderly, and the disabled are especially vulnerable during disasters. Early warning systems are crucial because they give public officials more lead time to better plan, prepare and protect communities before the hazard strikes. “It’s like watching the water wash away sandcastles at the beach; one minute a village is there and the next it is gone. Ground motion holds clues to when a slope is about to slide. Our job is to help develop reliable early warning systems through better forecasting tools that can read these clues and predict landslide hazards as early as possible,” said Tordesillas. The SAFE-RISCCS platform uses images from space, combined with a new open-access artificial intelligence tool invented at the University of Melbourne, to combine rain measurements and ever-changing ground motion data to continuously monitor and forecast the risk of a landslide at any one time in any one place. SAFE-RISCCS will be rolled out in two high-risk regions in partnership with Nepal’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, as part of a new Landslide Early Warning System being developed in Nepal. On April 25, 2015, the 7.8 magnitude Gorkha earthquake struck Nepal near the capital Kathmandu, triggering avalanches on Mt Everest and in the Langtang Valley and about 45,000 other landslides that destroyed parts of the city and wiped out thousands of villages. Professor Basanta Adhikari from Tribhuvan University said continuous monitoring of surface deformations is vital in protecting the people of Nepal. “The increasing occurrences of landslides in the Nepal Himalayas, driven by the coupling effect of seismotectonic activities and climate change alongside human-made factors such as haphazard road construction highlight the vulnerability of mountain communities,” said Adhikari. Professor Emanuele Intrieri from Florence University of Italy said raising awareness was the most effective way to reduce risk. “Recent developments in remote sensing allow us to monitor ground displacements from satellites with increasing sensitivity. Raising awareness about the risks affecting the area they are living in remains the most cost-effective solution to reduce the exposure,” said Intrieri. “Nepal is only one of several regions in the Asia-Pacific at risk of worsening natural disasters associated with climate change. By improving early landslide prediction globally, we reduce the risk of catastrophic events and so protect human life, people’s livelihoods, critical infrastructure and the environment,” Tordesillas added.",https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2024/06/06/new-landslide-forecasting-system-helping-researchers-save-lives-in-nepal,science-technology

The landing elevates China’s space power status in a global rush to the moon, where countries, including the United States, are hoping to exploit lunar minerals to sustain long-term astronaut missions and moon bases within the next decade. The Chang’e-6 craft, equipped with an array of tools and its own launcher, touched down in a gigantic impact crater called the South Pole-Aitken Basin on the moon's space-facing side at 6:23 a.m. Beijing time (2223 GMT), the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said in a statement on its website. The mission “involves many engineering innovations, high risks and great difficulty,” CNSA said. “The payloads carried by the Chang’e-6 lander will work as planned and carry out scientific exploration missions.” The successful mission is China’s second on the far side of the moon, a region no other country has reached. The back of the moon perpetually faces away from the Earth and is dotted with deep and dark craters, making communications and robotic landing operations more challenging. The Chang’e-6 probe launched on May 3 on China’s Long March 5 rocket from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on the southern island of Hainan, reaching the lunar vicinity roughly a week later before tightening its orbit in preparation for a landing. Using a scoop and drill, the lander will aim to collect 2 kg (4.4 pounds) of lunar material and bring it back to Earth. The samples will be transferred to a rocket booster atop the lander, which will launch back into space, tag up with another spacecraft in lunar orbit and return, with a landing in China’s Inner Mongolia region expected around June 25. If all goes as planned, the mission will provide China with a pristine record of the moon’s 4.5 billion-year history and yield new clues on the solar system’s formation. It will also allow for an unprecedented comparison between the dark, unexplored region with the moon’s better understood Earth-facing side. China’s broader lunar strategy includes its first astronaut landing around 2030 in a program in which it counts Russia as a burgeoning partner. In 2020 China conducted its first lunar sample return mission with Chang’e-5, retrieving samples from the moon’s near-facing side.

Launches of India’s second privately built rocket, and first using a combination of gas and liquid fuel, had been aborted three times before because of technical issues, including one flight that was cancelled about 90 seconds before lift-off. The launch, scheduled for 5:45 a.m. IST (0015 GMT) on Tuesday, was first delayed less than six minutes before lift-off “due to a technical glitch in the countdown activities”, and officials set a new lift-off time of 9:25 a.m. Only five seconds before lift-off, however, the launch was put on “temporary hold to check igniter performance”, then was called off altogether. The mission was expected to last two minutes and test the new ""semi-cryogenic"" engine and 3D-printed parts. If successful, it would have represented a technological step for India, whose Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has not yet successfully flown a semi-cryogenic engine, which uses a mix of liquid and gas for propellant. Agnikul Cosmos’ Agnibaan rocket is a customisable, 2-stage launch vehicle that can take up to 300 kg (about 660 lb) of payload to orbits about 700 km in altitude (435 miles), the company said. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy can put up to 63,500 kgs to low Earth orbit. India’s first privately developed rocket, from the company Skyroot, was flown from ISRO’s launch site in 2022.

Apple joins a list of major tech companies sued by US regulators, including Alphabet’s, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com across the administrations of both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. “Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.” The Justice Department, which was also joined by the District of Columbia in the lawsuit, alleges that Apple uses its market power to get more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses and merchants. The 88-page lawsuit, filed in US federal court in Newark, New Jersey, said it was focused on “freeing smartphone markets from Apple’s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future.” In the lawsuit, the US added that “Apple repeatedly chooses to make its products worse for consumers to prevent competition from emerging.” Apple disagreed in a statement, saying: “This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect.” Apple shares were trading 3% lower. Apple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in Europe, Japan and Korea, as well as lawsuits from corporate rivals such as Epic Games. One of Apple’s most lucrative businesses—its App Store, which charges developers commissions of up to 30%—has already survived a lengthy legal challenge under US law by Epic. While the lawsuit found that Apple did not violate antitrust laws, a federal judge ordered Apple to allow links and buttons to pay for apps without using Apple's in-app payment commission. In Europe, Apple’s App Store business model has been dismantled by a new law called the Digital Markets Act that went into effect earlier this month. Apple plans to let developers offer their own app stores - and, importantly, pay no commissions - but rivals such as Spotify and Epic argue Apple is still making it too hard to offer alternative app stores. The rulings on Apple’s App Store forced the Justice Department to look at Apple’s other practices for the basis of a complaint, such as how Apple allows outside firms to access the chips and sensors in the iPhone. Consumer hardware firms, such as smart-tracker maker Tile Inc, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone’s sensors while developing competing products that have greater access. Apple began selling AirTags—which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost—several years after Tile had been selling a similar product. Similarly, Apple has restricted access to a chip in the iPhone that allows for contactless payments. Credit cards can only be added to the iPhone by using Apple’s own Apple Pay service. And Apple has also faced criticism over its iMessage service, which only works on Apple devices. Apple has long argued that it restricts access to some user data and some of the iPhone’s hardware by third-party developers for privacy and security reasons.",https://kathmandupost.com/science-technology/2024/03/21/apple-accused-of-monopolizing-smartphone-markets-in-us-antitrust-lawsuit,science-technology

Heading not Found,Dil Kumar Ale Magar,"June 16, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"With a bit of luck Nepal’s fairytale victory would have been secured. The country’s hopes of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup ended after they lost to cricketing powerhouse South Africa by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller in their Group D match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent on Saturday. But their spirited performance earned praise worldwide after almost pulling off an upset win over one of the tournament favourites. Fielding first after winning the toss, the Rhinos restricted a strong Proteas team to a subpar 115-7 with their stupendous spin attack as Dipendra Singh Airee and part-time bowler Kushal Bhurtel shared all seven wickets that fell between them on a turning track. But they fell agonisingly short from recording their historic first ever victory over an ICC’s full-member nation after they could only manage 114-7. Despite the heartbreak, Nepal’s performance caught attention worldwide. “A performance to be proud of. Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter. South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show. “It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.” Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them. “Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.” Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!” “Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?” ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.” At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player. After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result. “We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.” He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].” Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage. Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries. But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase. Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game. Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings. Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand. After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs. But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls. Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat. Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls. Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Sompal Kami consoles Gulsan Jha (right) after Nepal lost their T20 World Cup Group D match against South Africa in Kingstown on Saturday. Hemanta Shrestha/TKP Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target. Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts. Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end. Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings. South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over. Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket. South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control. Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next. South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings. Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls. Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell. “I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said. South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling. “First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said. The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets. South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches. Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note. Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round. The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group.",https://kathmandupost.com/cricket/2024/06/16/nepal-lose-to-south-africa-win-over-the-world,cricket

Heading not Found,Reuters,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Germany thrashed 10-man Scotland 5-1 on Friday with three goals in the first half to make a triumphant start to their Euro 2024 campaign and lay down a marker with the biggest opening game margin of victory in the tournament’s history. The Germans, hunting a record fourth European title and first major trophy after a barren decade, scored through Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and a Kai Havertz penalty before Niclas Fuellkrug and Emre Can added two more late in the second half. Scotland, who had defender Ryan Porteous sent off on the stroke of halftime, got on the scoresheet in the 87th minute courtesy of Antonio Ruediger’s deflected own goal. Julian Nagelsmann’s Germany next face Hungary on Wednesday before taking on Switzerland in their final Group A match. “We played with a lot of intensity and played the right spaces, took some risks and that is why we scored. We played an outstanding first half and we were up 3-0,” Germany captain Ilkay Guendogan said. “That is how we wanted to start. I had a good feeling before the game and I was proved right.” “The start is what we wanted but still the goal we let in showed that all teams have quality and if you don't pay attention you will be punished.” The Scots, who lost Porteous for a studs-up challenge on Guendogan that earned the hosts their penalty, must quickly go back to the drawing board and regroup if they are to make it past the group stage for the first time in a major tournament. POWERFUL START The Germans, who lost their opening matches at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups as well as the previous Euros in 2021, dominated possession from the start with the Scots defending high. That ambitious strategy proved fatal for the visitors, who left far too many open spaces at the back, and it did not take long for the hosts to punish them. Toni Kroos flighted a perfect 30-metre cross for Joshua Kimmich who timed his pass to Wirtz perfectly for the winger to drill home for a 10th minute lead and become the youngest scorer for Germany at a Euros aged 21. With Scotland still recovering, Germany struck again nine minutes later, with Guendogan slipping another ball past the Scottish backline, this time for Havertz on the left, with the forward laying it off for Musiala in the box to rifle home. It was the start all of Germany was hoping for as hundreds of thousands of supporters across several fan zones erupted with joy, but there was more to come with Porteus’ reckless challenge and dismissal conceding a spot kick Havertz easily converted. It was one-way traffic again after the break and Germany added a fourth through substitute Fuellkrug’s fiercely struck shot in the 69th as Scotland coach Steve Clarke, the first man to lead the team to back-to-back Euros, looked on helplessly. “First half, we just got it all wrong really, didn’t show up, weren’t aggressive enough, and we let good players get on the ball,” said Scotland captain Andy Robertson. “Second half, we’re down to 10 men and I thought the lads dug in really well. We have to bounce back quickly because there was lots wrong here and it’s a quick turnaround now.” Scotland, who did not have one effort on or off target, pulled a goal back late on when Ruediger inadvertently headed the ball into his own net but substitute Emre Can then curled home a fine shot in stoppage time for the Germans’ fifth goal. The reeling Scots next play the Swiss on Wednesday.",https://kathmandupost.com/football/2024/06/15/hosts-germany-crush-10-man-scotland-5-1-in-euro-2024-opener,football

Heading not Found,Post Report,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal blew their chances of qualifying for the Super Eight of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup after losing to South Africa by a single run in a last-over nail-biter at the Arnos Vale Ground in West Indies. The Rhinos had everything on the line and were in need of two runs off the last ball of the game when Gulshan Jha was caught between the wickets by Quinton de Kock. Earlier, the Rhinos put up a great bowling display, restricting South Africa, who were sent to bat first, to a lowly total of 115 runs. Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 runs off 11 balls before being dismissed by Dipendra Singh Airee in 3.4 overs. Kushal Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after. Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks managed to stay on the ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavilion by Airee in 15.3 overs. Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play. Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-over spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs. Despite the easy chase, Nepal found themselves on the losing end, putting up 114 runs at a loss of seven wickets at the end of the stipulated 20 overs. The Rhinos were off to a good start with openers Bhurtel and Aashif Sheikh building a decent first-wicket partnership. However, the tides turned quickly for Nepal as South Africa’s Tabraiz Shamsi struck twice in a single over, dismissing Bhurtel for 13 in 7.2 overs, and captain Rohit Paudel for a duck only two deliveries later. Sheikh stood undeterred, building a half-century partnership with Anil Sah to bring some much-needed relief to the Nepali innings. Sah scored 27 runs, which featured three boundaries and a six, before being caught by Marco Jansen off Aiden Markram. Just as the innings were steadying for the Rhinos, Shamsi struck again, proving a thorn in Nepal’s flesh. Nepal were in need of 18 runs off as many deliveries at the end of 16 overs when they dealt a massive blow, losing Dipendra Singh Airee (6), Aasif Sheikh (42) and Kushal Malla (1) in a span of five balls. Tension ran high as Nepal were still in need of eight runs with an over to spare. Gulshan Jha, who took to the field at number seven, missed twice, narrowing the game down to eight runs with four deliveries in hand. Jha then smashed a boundary. The game was down to two runs off as many balls, but he missed again. With only a single delivery remaining, Jha and his partner Sompal Kami made the run for an equaliser, but the former was run out, ending Nepal’s hopes of competing in the World Cup. For South Africa, Tabraiz Shamsi grabbed four wickets while Aiden Markram also dismissed a Nepali batter.",https://kathmandupost.com/cricket/2024/06/15/nepal-lose-to-south-africa-by-one-run-in-a-nailbiter,cricket

Heading not Found,Dil Kumar Ale Magar,"June 12, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal can finally breathe a sigh of relief and will have at least something to cheer for when they return home from Saudi Arabia—thanks to a spirited battle against a strong Yemen. The Gorkhalis headed into their last Group H game of the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers against Yemen on Tuesday low in confidence after losing all of their previous five matches, with their most recent embarrassment coming in a 4-0 drubbing by group winners United Arab Emirates last week. Vincenzo Alberto Annese’s men had conceded 18 goals in five qualifiers matches, scoring none in reply. Nepal’s dismal qualifiers campaign was also partly contributed by the sheer negligence of sports authorities All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) and National Sports Council whose poor management of the country’s only international standard football venue—Dasharath Stadium—forced Nepal to play their two home matches at neutral venues. However, on Tuesday, they floored Yemen with a dogged fightback until the death after initially falling behind to a ninth minute Nasser Al Gahwashi penalty at the Prince Mohammad bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam, thanks to Sanjeeb Bista and Gillespye Jung Karki whose goals either side of the half time turned things around for Nepal. Although Mohammed Al Dahi’s equaliser in the first minute of stoppage time denied them a first victory of the qualifiers and also a first win against Yemen, their dogged display will still serve as a testament that the youth Nepali squad have a lot of potential. The draw against Yemen will especially wash the burden off the Italian coach Annese whose contract with Nepal is expiring this month. Annese, who was appointed as Nepal head coach in March last year, has been under a sharp knife following a series of disappointing results that also included a draw against minnows Bhutan, disappointing SAFF Championship campaign and World Cup Qualifiers first round struggles against Laos. The 39-year-old coach has been using the exodus of Nepali football stars including Bimal Gharti Magar and Sujal Shrestha to Australia and an inexperienced squad as his defence for Nepal’s poor run of results in the international arena. But he seems to have finally cracked the code in his probably last game with Nepal as coach. And the output against Yemen could possibly convince ANFA to trigger another extension in his contract. ANFA had added a three-month extension in Annese’s contract this year. The emergence of Sanjeeb, who only made his international debut in March this year as an 88th minute substitute during a 5-0 qualifiers loss to Bahrain, is even more promising. Sanjeeb, who played full 90 minutes in Nepal’s 3-0 loss against Bahrain before being benched in 4-0 defeat to the UAE, had a hand in both of Nepal’s goals against Yemen in Dammam. Sanjeeb, who replaced star forward Anjan Bista in the front, first pounced on a misplaced back pass from Radhawan Al Hubaishi and bent the ball past Yemen goalkeeper Mohammed Khairalah to score an equaliser in the 22nd minute. Sanjeeb then received a long pass from Chhiring Lama and served it for Karki to head home Nepal’s second goal in the 66th. It was the first international goals for both Sanjeeb and Karki. Karki made his debut for Nepal in September last year during Nepal’s goalless draw with Myanmar. Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu prepares to shoot the ball during the Group H match of the second roundof the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers against Yemen in Dammam, Saudi Arabiaon Tuesday. The evening was also memorable for Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Playing his 100th international match, the 34-year-old goalkeeper produced a string of stunning saves to keep Yemen at bay till the final moments and helped Nepal earn a point. Even though Nepal failed to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and could not directly qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup, they still have a chance to secure their spot in their maiden Asian Cup through Asian Cup Qualification which will be played between March 25, 2025 to March 31, 2026.

Heading not Found,Reuters,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"World leaders gathered at a Swiss mountain resort on Saturday to try to build support for Ukraine's peace proposals at a summit skipped by US President Joe Biden, shunned by China and dismissed as a waste of time by Moscow. More than 90 countries will take part, but China's absence in particular has dimmed hopes the summit would show Russia as globally isolated, while recent military reverses have put Kyiv on the back foot. The war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas has also diverted the world's attention from Ukraine. The talks will focus on broader concerns triggered by the war, such as food and nuclear security. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has trumpeted the summit's wide attendance as a success and predicted ""history being made"", adding that agreements stemming from it will be part of the peacemaking process. ""Ukraine never wanted this war. It's a criminal and absolutely unprovoked aggression by Russia,"" he said alongside Swiss President Viola Amherd, who said the conflict had brought ""unimaginable suffering"" and violated international law. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the gathering an important step to discuss peace and security questions. ""This is a small plant that needs to be watered, but of course also with the perspective that more can then come out of it,"" he told Welt TV. Biden sent US Vice President Kamala Harris to represent him—riling Kyiv—while Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be represented by his foreign minister and India dispatched a lower-level delegation. Beijing is staying away after Russia was frozen out of proceedings. Harris announced more than $1.5 billion in energy and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, where infrastructure has been pounded by Russian airstrikes since the 2022 invasion. ""This war remains an utter failure for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,"" Harris said during a meeting with Zelenskiy. A military helicopter hovered over the luxury Buergenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne on Saturday as leaders arrived by helicopter on a patch of grassland fenced off with razor wire while cows grazed nearby. On the eve of the summit, Putin said Russia would end the war only if Kyiv agreed to drop its NATO ambitions and hand over four provinces claimed by Moscow—demands Kyiv swiftly rejected as tantamount to surrender. Putin's conditions apparently reflected Moscow's growing confidence that its forces have the upper hand in the war. Scholz cast them as an attempt to muddy the waters. ""Everyone knows that this is not a serious proposal, but had something to do with the peace conference in Switzerland,"" he said in a separate TV interview. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Putin's proposal had ""shown the real path to peace"". ""If you want to save the world, discuss Vladimir Putin's proposal ... Only those who do not want peace can't see, can't understand it,"" TASS news agency quoted her as saying.

The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada and Japan are among those due to attend. Turkey and Hungary, which maintain friendlier ties with Russia, are also expected to join. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said it was an opportunity to start building a broader global consensus to put pressure on Russia. ""It's like we're in a Western echo chamber. That is: all Western European countries, the USA, we agree on what we want to happen with Ukraine,"" Nehammer said. ""But that alone is not enough."" Neutral Switzerland, which took on the summit at Zelenskiy's behest, wants to pave the way for a future peace process that includes Russia. Saudi Arabia or Turkey have been mooted as possible hosts.

Heading not Found,Reuters,"June 15, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"US President Joe Biden could soon announce a new effort to allow immigrants in the US illegally to obtain legal status if they are married to US citizens, three sources said, an election-year move that could energize some liberal voters. Biden is expected to unveil the effort as soon as Tuesday at a White House event, two of the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal plans still subject to change. Biden, a Democrat, is seeking a second term in the November 5 election that will pit him against Republican challenger Donald Trump, an immigration hardliner. Biden has grappled with record numbers of migrants caught crossing the US-Mexico border illegally on his watch and recently rolled out a restrictive new asylum ban at the border to deter crossers. Some fellow Democrats and immigrant advocates opposed the asylum ban and have called on Biden to protect long-term US residents who lack legal status, including spouses. Reuters reported in April that the White House was considering ways to allow the spouses to obtain legal status. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez did not confirm any coming immigration relief, but said in a statement that Biden officials “remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.” Biden said in June 4 remarks on the asylum ban that in coming weeks he would “speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.” Tuesday’s White House event will be tied to the anniversary of the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The DACA program was launched by former President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Biden and currently grants deportation relief and work permits to 528,000 people brought to the US as children. The US State Department also could roll out new guidance that says DACA recipients should be presumed eligible for non-immigrant visas if they leave the US, one of the sources said. Representative Nanette Barragan, a Democrat and head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said she would attend the White House event and urged Biden to take action to protect spouses of US. citizens and DACA recipients. Barragan said in an interview that Biden could contrast himself with Trump, who has vowed to launch the largest deportation effort in US history. “I think it could be significant for the lives of these people who are living in the shadows, who are married to American citizens and who are under threat of being removed from the country,” she said. An estimated 1.1 million immigrants in the US illegally are married to US citizens, according to data by advocacy organization FWD.us, but how many of those would be included in a possible Biden action remained unclear.",https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/06/15/biden-poised-to-announce-immigration-relief-for-spouses-of-us-citizens-sources-say,world

South Korea’s vice foreign minister, Kim Hong-kyun, in the phone call with US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, said that Putin’s visit should not result in deeper military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, the ministry said. Echoing Kim’s concerns, Campbell pledged continued cooperation to tackle potential regional instability and challenges caused by the trip. ‘While closely monitoring related developments, the two sides agreed to resolutely respond through airtight cooperation to North Korea’s provocations against South Korea and actions that escalate tensions in the region,” the ministry said in a statement. On Wednesday, a senior official at Seoul’s presidential office said Putin was expected to visit North Korea “in the coming days”. Russia’s Vedomosti newspaper on Monday reported Putin would visit North Korea and Vietnam in the coming weeks. Civilian aircraft have been cleared from Pyongyang’s airport and there are signs of preparations for a possible parade in the capital’s Kim Il Sung Square, NK PRO, a Seoul-based website, reported this week, citing commercial satellite imagery. When Sergei Shoigu, then Russia’s defence minister, visited Pyongyang last year to jumpstart the two countries’ warming ties, he accompanied Kim to a parade and saluted as North Korea’s banned nuclear-tipped missiles rolled by. Speaking at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington on Wednesday, Campbell said the United States has a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia, which he said has had “a substantial impact on the battlefield”. Less clear, he said, is what Russia has provided North Korea. “Hard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products? We don’t know. But we’re concerned by that and watching carefully,” he said.",https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/06/14/south-korea-us-warn-against-north-korea-russia-military-ties-ahead-of-putin-visit,world

Heading not Found,Reuters,"June 14, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Leaders of the Group of Seven major democracies agreed on an outline deal on Thursday to provide $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow invaded its neighbour in 2022. The political agreement was the centrepiece of the opening day in southern Italy of the annual summit of G7 leaders, attended for a second successive year by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He signed a new, long-term security accord with US President Joe Biden after signing a 10-year security accord with Japan, with Tokyo promising to provide Kyiv with $4.5 billion this year — underlining continued strong backing from the West. Calling the frozen asset agreement a “significant outcome”, Biden told reporters it was “another reminder to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin that we’re not backing down.” The G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multi-year loan using profits from some $300 billion of impounded Russian funds, the bulk of which are blocked in the European Union. The technical details will be finalised in the coming weeks, with the new cash expected to reach Kyiv by the end of this year thanks to contributions from all G7 states — the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and Italy. “This is a very clear commitment that should embolden the Ukrainians to do what they need to to defend their independence and sovereignty,” said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The aim of the deal is to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be much less sympathetic to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November’s election, according to a person close to the talks. Russia regards attempts by the West to take income from its frozen assets as criminal, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday, adding that Moscow’s response would be very painful for the European Union. Struggles at home Many of the G7 leaders are struggling at home but looked to project confidence on the world stage as they confront an array of problems, including China’s economic ambitions, the growth of artificial intelligence and turmoil in the Middle East. The leaders expressed their concerns about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border and endorsed US efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza war, according to a draft communique due to be released following the summit. In addition, they called on Israel to refrain from a full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, “in line with their obligations under international law”. Western nations are also expected to voice both unanimous concern over China’s industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said. The G7 may have a very different complexion next year. Biden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power in a national election next month, while French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country’s parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote. All smiled broadly as they greeted Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni under a blazing Mediterranean sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where the summit is being held. However, the display of unity was undermined late in the day, when Macron clashed with the anti-abortion Meloni over a push by Italy to remove any direct reference to abortion rights in the final communique. More than a dozen outsiders will join the discussions on Friday, including the leaders of India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya, while Pope Francis is due to speak about the risks and potential of artificial intelligence.",https://kathmandupost.com/world/2024/06/14/g7-agrees-on-loan-deal-to-support-ukraine-with-russian-assets,world

Temperatures this week are forecast to scale record highs in parts of China as countries across Asia brace themselves for another summer of extreme weather. China's Water Resources Ministry this week launched emergency responses to manage drought on in Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces, indicating various regions in the country spanning the northwest to the east are facing parched and scorching conditions. With dwindling precipitation since May in areas around the Yellow River Basin, in combination with the onset of searing temperatures this month, drought is threatening cultivated land that were being prepared to be sown as well as sown crops, Xinhua reported. The harsh weather conditions will feature until the end of next week, with drought expected to worsen, the official media said. In some parts of Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces, temperatures could reach 44 degrees Celsius (111.2 degrees Fahrenheit), potentially breaking historical records for the month of June, state broadcaster CCTV said. Surface temperatures could hit 70 C in some localities including in Shanxi and Shaanxi, it added. The emergency management ministry has alerted affected regions including northwestern Shaanxi, northern Hebei and Shanxi, eastern Anhui and Shandong as well as central Henan to protect water and food production.

Heading not Found,Prawash Gautam,"February 10, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The atmosphere engulfed by a thick fog and grounds frosty, Kathmandu Valley would have already been deep into winter by mid-Mangsir. Sitting for final exams, Sagar Neupane’s hands turned stiff with freezing cold and his heart stirred a little in the fear that he might fail. But there was something that warmed his core. “More than the fear of failing the exams, my heart would be filled with the happy anticipation of minpachas right around the corner,” said the 60-year-old from Chuchhepati. Minpachas ( min means fish, pachas is fifty in Nepali) or the fifty days from mid-Mangsir to mid-Magh were so cold that even fishes deep under the waters hid below the rocks to keep warm. And schools closed. As biting cold gripped the valley, its students found their moment of freedom. Cut loose from the monotony of school, before them unfolded the season of games, adventures and travels. A misty morning in Kathmandu in 1982. Photo: Helmut Schadt via Nepal Photo Foundation. Out of Kathmandu’s biting cold, a time of freedom Gobinda Khanal, 87, grew up in Shankhamul by the banks of Bagmati, and carries vivid memories of Kathmandu's long, freezing winters with characteristic dense fog and frosty grounds. “Cold would have already set in by Kartik,” he said. “Mid-Mangsir through Paush and Magh, all we saw was the dense white fog obscuring everything before us. The grounds would be white with frost. The fog cleared only around noon when the sun rays cut through it. During Paush and Magh, winter peaked. “As children, we filled bowls with water and put them on the rooftop in the evening. In the morning, we found the water frozen into an ice sheet as thick as a table mirror. Even the flowing waters of Bagmati froze. Thin sheets of ice formed on its surface.” To beat the cold, Kathmandu sat around its agenos , a traditional Nepali fireplace, or makal , an earthen coal-carrier. For schools, minpachas offered a strategy to close for cold as well as wind down the academic calendar. “For the entire year, we had to be under the watchful eyes of the teachers, but during minpachas we were free,” said Jeetendra Vaidya, 56, from Jayabageshwari. This allowed the students time for travel, tours, games and adventure. Travels to the Tarai farms and maternal homes Veteran filmmaker and lyricist Yadav Kharel’s family had an estate in Saptari. Every minpachas, Kharel travelled with family to spend the holidays there. In an article ""'Black out' Gariyeko Yuwaraj Birendrako Tyo Antarwarta"" by Ghanendra Ojha published in Shilapatra, Kharel describes his journey to Saptari via India in the 1950s. “After reaching Amlekhgunj on foot, we travelled via small train up to Raxaul, and from Raxaul we travelled on the train across India to reach the Indian border at Saptari. Then we crossed back to Nepal and travelled on a bullock cart to reach our farmlands,” the 81-year-old is quoted as saying. Like Kharel, Kathmandu residents who had estates in the Tarai moved to their farmhouses during minpachas. For Govinda Tandon, who was born and grew up in Battisputali, minpachas meant travelling to his family’s estate in Chaughada near Hetauda in Makwanpur since he was seven years old. “We spent almost all of minpachas there and returned just a few days before the school reopened,” said the 69-year-old historian and heritage expert. From Chaughada, Tandon also went to his maternal home in Trishuli Danda, which was not far from his family’s estate. In fact, those growing up in the 1990s or before state that their visits to maternal homes specifically happened during these holidays. “Whenever I think of the term minpachas, I remember my maternal home,” said 64-year-old Bishnu Bhakta Shrestha from Bhaktapur. “We travelled on foot from Kathmandu, staying over at someone’s place for the night before reaching our maternal home in Khursanitar in Nuwakot.” A Kathmandu girl plays during winter in the 1970s. Photo: Alain van Hille via courtesy of Nepal Photo Foundation Children’s season of marbles What about the children who did not have a distant place to go to? “Children who didn’t have anywhere far to travel made plans well in advance about how they would spend the holiday locally with friends,” said Tandon. Among these games, one reigned across generations. In ‘Tyas Bakhatko Nepal’, speaking about Kathmandu in the first half of the twentieth century, Bhim Bahadur Pande writes that “the most popular game for the boys was marbles”. “The main game we played during minpachas was marbles,” said biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, speaking of his childhood in the 1940s and early 1950s in and around Mahabauddha. Children collected packets of cigarettes—Fulmar, Busmar, Otmar, Catmar, Asha, Craven, 555—and neatly cut them into pieces and set monetary values on them. Winners of the marble games received the kittas depending on the value set for the papers. “High-quality cigarettes like Craven and 555 had high value because they were foreign and rare, while local brands had lower value,” Shrestha said. “We stacked our wins and took home and took delight in our prize, that’s all.” Three decades later, in the 1970s, Neupane was also playing marbles with his friends during minpachas using kittas , as was Raju Kapali from Patan in the 1980s. When schools reopened, the marbles mysteriously disappeared, Kapali said when I interviewed him in 2018 for an article ‘Minpachas: Nepal’s Winter Holidays of Yesteryears’, published in ECS Nepal magazine. He said that children returned to school and bragged about how many marbles they had won. Fishing in Kathmandu rivers Rabindra Man Joshi was born in Chabahil, which, up until the 1970s, was a small settlement on the outskirts of Kathmandu. For him and his peers, minpachas meant fishing in Bagmati. “My friends and I prepared fishing lines and caught fish in Bagmati right down Pashupati in the Tilganga area,” Joshi said in the interview for the 2018 minpachas article. Indeed, for many boys growing up in the Valley until the 1980s, fishing was a common activity throughout the year. “We even bunked our classes to go fishing,” Vaidya said. “Obviously, during minpachas, more leisure provided more time for fishing.” Kathmandu’s rivers were always central to minpachas for generations before Joshi’s. When Khanal was growing up, groups of boys from Patan core came down to Shankhamul. Khanal spent many minpachas afternoons sitting by the Bagmati banks, looking at those boys fishing. “Fresh, clear water flowed in the Bagmati and you could see a large number of asala machha [snow trouts],” Khanal said. “The boys blocked the water with sand and stones and pebbles to form a pool and caught fish using their hands.” While fishing was a common minpachas activity for many children in different parts of Kathmandu, those growing up around airport, like Joshi and Vaidya, also had certain unique experiences. Indeed, there were games and adventures that were specific to particular localities and generations.

Photo: Mel Goldman via Courtesy of Nepal Photo Foundation Quail fights, airport adventures Shrestha’s father raised a few quails during the months of Mangsir-Magh every year in the 1940s and 1950s. “He reared them for quail flights, something that specifically happened during minpachas,” said Shrestha. “During minpachas, it was common to see people gathered for cock and quail fights in different localities.” On Tuesdays and Saturdays, the quail owners brought along their best fighters and gathered in the set locations. They placed bets of Rs10, Rs20 or sometimes even the fighting quail. Shrestha accompanied his father or went on his own, taking his most prized quail for fights. Such fights were also organised in the Rana durbars, and Shrestha has fond memories of taking his quail for fights at Basanta Shumsher’s Bagh Durbar in Sundhara. “We took our best quail to fight at Sushil Shumsher’s if we felt that it was good enough to win over others,” he said. While these games, Shrestha recalled, were specific to a generation, there were adventures that were specific to particular locations and generations. Adventures in Kathmandu’s Gauchar airport stood out too. For decades after it officially opened, the Gauchar airport was cleared of grazing cows and playing children only to allow planes to land and take off. Later, only a wire netting bound its territory. Well into the 1970s, for children from the airport’s surroundings, minpachas was a time to experience adventure like no other. During the interview for the 2018 article, Joshi said that he and his friends often crossed over the wire nets into the airport and dug through garbage bins near the terminal building. “We mostly looked for empty, colourful packets of cigarettes tossed by foreigners,” he said. Sometimes, greater adventure lay in store: the hanger would be open, as well as the door of the plane inside. “We climbed into the planes and hunted for chocolates and toffees and their bright wraps,” he said. “It was a different world inside the plane.” Teenagers’ time for tours and picnics By the 1970s, students were already planning and taking tours during minpachas. As a teenage student in the 1980s, Vaidya made several trips to Manakamana, Gorkha and Pokhara with his friends. He visited Manakamana for the first time with his parents during minpachas. Later, in senior classes, he and his friends went on trips of their own. “We waited for these trips and planned for them before minpachas started,” said Vaidya during an interview for the 2018 article. “Some groups combined trips to the historical Gorkha, then to Manakamana Temple, and then finally to Pokhara.” Picnics were also common during minpachas. Schoolchildren formed groups and organised picnics in the open fields or jungles near their homes. “For such picnics, we took food and other materials from our respective homes and cooked and ate in the open fields near the back of our homes. Boys and girls had separate groups, we didn’t mix,” Neupane said. Return to books In a letter to the editor of Gorkhapatra dated January 5, 1948, a student complained that long holidays like minpachas cut down on teaching time. “Those who cannot afford to keep home tutors have to rely on school for their studies,” the student wrote. “Due to vacations like minpachas, Dashain and Tihar, schools run for only 4–5 months.” The sight of their children running carefree worried some parents lest they strayed from their studies forever. “Some of my friends played hiding from their parents,” Neupane said. “Sometimes the parents came chasing their children with sticks and took them home to study.” Many parents and guardians found ways to continue their children’s studies. Schools in the plains would be running as were many in the hills. Many, like Kharel, who went to these places enrolled in local schools. “I enrolled in a local school in Saptari for the entire period of minpachas,” he is quoted in the article. Minpachas also offered a reason to celebrate books. The final exam results were out around mid-Paush. This unleashed an excitement of buying and engaging with books. Kapil Lohani, who grew up in Kathmandu, rejoiced in receiving new books during minpachas. “We were called to school once during Magh with our guardians to receive our results and report cards,” he writes in his article ‘ Pustak Padhnuko Afnai Majja ’ published in DC Nepal on March 23, 2023. “We were also handed a list of books of the upper class during the occasion.” “We felt such unique excitement and energy while going to buy books and copies [note books] according to the list and putting covers on those books,” he said. “We spent the next few days browsing the new books.” A farmer in front of Nyatapol Temple veiled under a misty morning in Bhaktapur in 1968. Magnum Photos, Photographer: Hiroji Kubota End of minpachas Just like Kathmandu’s winters, minpachas is long gone. Kathmandu’s temperature has increased in the past 30 years as climate change combines with the urban heat island (UHI) effect caused by unplanned urbanisation. “To some extent, the end of minpachas could be due to warmer winters,” said watershed expert Madhukar Upadhya, who grew up in Deupatan. “But I think it mainly owes to the change in the academic calendar. Classes started in Falgun and we had final exams in Mangsir and then we had minpachas. When a series of changes happened in the academic calendar and curriculum with the initiation of the New Education policy in 1972, this eventually also impacted minpachas.” More recent academic calendars start in Baisakh and end in Chaitra. But what if Kathmandu’s winters were longer and colder and minpachas was still around? “Where is that Bagmati where children could go fishing?” said Khanal. “Would children find fish in this Bagmati where sewage flows?” said Khanal. But children might not even want to go out fishing in the first place, or go hunting for cigarette packets to create kittas for their marble games. Nor would mothers have to go after their children and bring them home to read. For, with the digital age, children have turned to screens as a perpetual source of entertainment. “Today’s children don’t have the opportunity to experience the games and adventures in nature that we did,” Neupane said, echoing the sentiments of his contemporaries as well as generations before his. “Kathmandu no longer has open space for play. They too would prefer their mobile phones to outside adventures.” Swayambhunath rises above Kathmandu’s foggy sky in this photo taken from Nagarjuna hilltop in the 1970s.

Heading not Found,Prawash Gautam,"February 10, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The atmosphere engulfed by a thick fog and grounds frosty, Kathmandu Valley would have already been deep into winter by mid-Mangsir. Sitting for final exams, Sagar Neupane’s hands turned stiff with freezing cold and his heart stirred a little in the fear that he might fail. But there was something that warmed his core. “More than the fear of failing the exams, my heart would be filled with the happy anticipation of minpachas right around the corner,” said the 60-year-old from Chuchhepati. Minpachas ( min means fish, pachas is fifty in Nepali) or the fifty days from mid-Mangsir to mid-Magh were so cold that even fishes deep under the waters hid below the rocks to keep warm. And schools closed. As biting cold gripped the valley, its students found their moment of freedom. Cut loose from the monotony of school, before them unfolded the season of games, adventures and travels. A misty morning in Kathmandu in 1982. Photo: Helmut Schadt via Nepal Photo Foundation. Out of Kathmandu’s biting cold, a time of freedom Gobinda Khanal, 87, grew up in Shankhamul by the banks of Bagmati, and carries vivid memories of Kathmandu's long, freezing winters with characteristic dense fog and frosty grounds. “Cold would have already set in by Kartik,” he said. “Mid-Mangsir through Paush and Magh, all we saw was the dense white fog obscuring everything before us. The grounds would be white with frost. The fog cleared only around noon when the sun rays cut through it. During Paush and Magh, winter peaked. “As children, we filled bowls with water and put them on the rooftop in the evening. In the morning, we found the water frozen into an ice sheet as thick as a table mirror. Even the flowing waters of Bagmati froze. Thin sheets of ice formed on its surface.” To beat the cold, Kathmandu sat around its agenos , a traditional Nepali fireplace, or makal , an earthen coal-carrier. For schools, minpachas offered a strategy to close for cold as well as wind down the academic calendar. “For the entire year, we had to be under the watchful eyes of the teachers, but during minpachas we were free,” said Jeetendra Vaidya, 56, from Jayabageshwari. This allowed the students time for travel, tours, games and adventure. Travels to the Tarai farms and maternal homes Veteran filmmaker and lyricist Yadav Kharel’s family had an estate in Saptari. Every minpachas, Kharel travelled with family to spend the holidays there. In an article ""'Black out' Gariyeko Yuwaraj Birendrako Tyo Antarwarta"" by Ghanendra Ojha published in Shilapatra, Kharel describes his journey to Saptari via India in the 1950s. “After reaching Amlekhgunj on foot, we travelled via small train up to Raxaul, and from Raxaul we travelled on the train across India to reach the Indian border at Saptari. Then we crossed back to Nepal and travelled on a bullock cart to reach our farmlands,” the 81-year-old is quoted as saying. Like Kharel, Kathmandu residents who had estates in the Tarai moved to their farmhouses during minpachas. For Govinda Tandon, who was born and grew up in Battisputali, minpachas meant travelling to his family’s estate in Chaughada near Hetauda in Makwanpur since he was seven years old. “We spent almost all of minpachas there and returned just a few days before the school reopened,” said the 69-year-old historian and heritage expert. From Chaughada, Tandon also went to his maternal home in Trishuli Danda, which was not far from his family’s estate. In fact, those growing up in the 1990s or before state that their visits to maternal homes specifically happened during these holidays. “Whenever I think of the term minpachas, I remember my maternal home,” said 64-year-old Bishnu Bhakta Shrestha from Bhaktapur. “We travelled on foot from Kathmandu, staying over at someone’s place for the night before reaching our maternal home in Khursanitar in Nuwakot.” A Kathmandu girl plays during winter in the 1970s. Photo: Alain van Hille via courtesy of Nepal Photo Foundation Children’s season of marbles What about the children who did not have a distant place to go to? “Children who didn’t have anywhere far to travel made plans well in advance about how they would spend the holiday locally with friends,” said Tandon. Among these games, one reigned across generations. In ‘Tyas Bakhatko Nepal’, speaking about Kathmandu in the first half of the twentieth century, Bhim Bahadur Pande writes that “the most popular game for the boys was marbles”. “The main game we played during minpachas was marbles,” said biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, speaking of his childhood in the 1940s and early 1950s in and around Mahabauddha. Children collected packets of cigarettes—Fulmar, Busmar, Otmar, Catmar, Asha, Craven, 555—and neatly cut them into pieces and set monetary values on them. Winners of the marble games received the kittas depending on the value set for the papers. “High-quality cigarettes like Craven and 555 had high value because they were foreign and rare, while local brands had lower value,” Shrestha said. “We stacked our wins and took home and took delight in our prize, that’s all.” Three decades later, in the 1970s, Neupane was also playing marbles with his friends during minpachas using kittas , as was Raju Kapali from Patan in the 1980s. When schools reopened, the marbles mysteriously disappeared, Kapali said when I interviewed him in 2018 for an article ‘Minpachas: Nepal’s Winter Holidays of Yesteryears’, published in ECS Nepal magazine. He said that children returned to school and bragged about how many marbles they had won. Fishing in Kathmandu rivers Rabindra Man Joshi was born in Chabahil, which, up until the 1970s, was a small settlement on the outskirts of Kathmandu. For him and his peers, minpachas meant fishing in Bagmati. “My friends and I prepared fishing lines and caught fish in Bagmati right down Pashupati in the Tilganga area,” Joshi said in the interview for the 2018 minpachas article. Indeed, for many boys growing up in the Valley until the 1980s, fishing was a common activity throughout the year. “We even bunked our classes to go fishing,” Vaidya said. “Obviously, during minpachas, more leisure provided more time for fishing.” Kathmandu’s rivers were always central to minpachas for generations before Joshi’s. When Khanal was growing up, groups of boys from Patan core came down to Shankhamul. Khanal spent many minpachas afternoons sitting by the Bagmati banks, looking at those boys fishing. “Fresh, clear water flowed in the Bagmati and you could see a large number of asala machha [snow trouts],” Khanal said. “The boys blocked the water with sand and stones and pebbles to form a pool and caught fish using their hands.” While fishing was a common minpachas activity for many children in different parts of Kathmandu, those growing up around airport, like Joshi and Vaidya, also had certain unique experiences. Indeed, there were games and adventures that were specific to particular localities and generations.

They placed bets of Rs10, Rs20 or sometimes even the fighting quail. Shrestha accompanied his father or went on his own, taking his most prized quail for fights. Such fights were also organised in the Rana durbars, and Shrestha has fond memories of taking his quail for fights at Basanta Shumsher’s Bagh Durbar in Sundhara. “We took our best quail to fight at Sushil Shumsher’s if we felt that it was good enough to win over others,” he said. While these games, Shrestha recalled, were specific to a generation, there were adventures that were specific to particular locations and generations. Adventures in Kathmandu’s Gauchar airport stood out too. For decades after it officially opened, the Gauchar airport was cleared of grazing cows and playing children only to allow planes to land and take off. Later, only a wire netting bound its territory. Well into the 1970s, for children from the airport’s surroundings, minpachas was a time to experience adventure like no other. During the interview for the 2018 article, Joshi said that he and his friends often crossed over the wire nets into the airport and dug through garbage bins near the terminal building. “We mostly looked for empty, colourful packets of cigarettes tossed by foreigners,” he said. Sometimes, greater adventure lay in store: the hanger would be open, as well as the door of the plane inside. “We climbed into the planes and hunted for chocolates and toffees and their bright wraps,” he said. “It was a different world inside the plane.” Teenagers’ time for tours and picnics By the 1970s, students were already planning and taking tours during minpachas. As a teenage student in the 1980s, Vaidya made several trips to Manakamana, Gorkha and Pokhara with his friends. He visited Manakamana for the first time with his parents during minpachas. Later, in senior classes, he and his friends went on trips of their own. “We waited for these trips and planned for them before minpachas started,” said Vaidya during an interview for the 2018 article. “Some groups combined trips to the historical Gorkha, then to Manakamana Temple, and then finally to Pokhara.” Picnics were also common during minpachas. Schoolchildren formed groups and organised picnics in the open fields or jungles near their homes. “For such picnics, we took food and other materials from our respective homes and cooked and ate in the open fields near the back of our homes. Boys and girls had separate groups, we didn’t mix,” Neupane said. Return to books In a letter to the editor of Gorkhapatra dated January 5, 1948, a student complained that long holidays like minpachas cut down on teaching time. “Those who cannot afford to keep home tutors have to rely on school for their studies,” the student wrote. “Due to vacations like minpachas, Dashain and Tihar, schools run for only 4–5 months.” The sight of their children running carefree worried some parents lest they strayed from their studies forever. “Some of my friends played hiding from their parents,” Neupane said. “Sometimes the parents came chasing their children with sticks and took them home to study.” Many parents and guardians found ways to continue their children’s studies. Schools in the plains would be running as were many in the hills. Many, like Kharel, who went to these places enrolled in local schools. “I enrolled in a local school in Saptari for the entire period of minpachas,” he is quoted in the article. Minpachas also offered a reason to celebrate books. The final exam results were out around mid-Paush. This unleashed an excitement of buying and engaging with books. Kapil Lohani, who grew up in Kathmandu, rejoiced in receiving new books during minpachas. “We were called to school once during Magh with our guardians to receive our results and report cards,” he writes in his article ‘ Pustak Padhnuko Afnai Majja ’ published in DC Nepal on March 23, 2023. “We were also handed a list of books of the upper class during the occasion.” “We felt such unique excitement and energy while going to buy books and copies [note books] according to the list and putting covers on those books,” he said. “We spent the next few days browsing the new books.” A farmer in front of Nyatapol Temple veiled under a misty morning in Bhaktapur in 1968. Magnum Photos, Photographer: Hiroji Kubota End of minpachas Just like Kathmandu’s winters, minpachas is long gone. Kathmandu’s temperature has increased in the past 30 years as climate change combines with the urban heat island (UHI) effect caused by unplanned urbanisation. “To some extent, the end of minpachas could be due to warmer winters,” said watershed expert Madhukar Upadhya, who grew up in Deupatan. “But I think it mainly owes to the change in the academic calendar. Classes started in Falgun and we had final exams in Mangsir and then we had minpachas. When a series of changes happened in the academic calendar and curriculum with the initiation of the New Education policy in 1972, this eventually also impacted minpachas.” More recent academic calendars start in Baisakh and end in Chaitra. But what if Kathmandu’s winters were longer and colder and minpachas was still around? “Where is that Bagmati where children could go fishing?” said Khanal. “Would children find fish in this Bagmati where sewage flows?” said Khanal. But children might not even want to go out fishing in the first place, or go hunting for cigarette packets to create kittas for their marble games. Nor would mothers have to go after their children and bring them home to read. For, with the digital age, children have turned to screens as a perpetual source of entertainment. “Today’s children don’t have the opportunity to experience the games and adventures in nature that we did,” Neupane said, echoing the sentiments of his contemporaries as well as generations before his. “Kathmandu no longer has open space for play.

Heading not Found,Upendra Raj Pandey,"July 31, 2023",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.” Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.” Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. “We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post. The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.” Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it. ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu. In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.” Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that. Taslima’s books are the major victims Taslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri). The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said. Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral. Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.” Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.” Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office. Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said. Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission. The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively. Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said. Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added. Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said. Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds. One’s pain, another’s pleasure When the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.” This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange. Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal. Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.” As tax increases, so does piracy The government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy. “After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.” Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise. Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market. The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India. James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks. Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange. Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others. Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.” By the law The Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright. According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright. Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’ If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax. The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators. Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.” Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of. “In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.” ( This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal .)",https://kathmandupost.com/books/2023/07/31/unauthorised-translation-and-piracy-of-foreign-books-thrive-in-nepal,books

Heading not Found,Urza Acharya,"July 1, 2023",Kathmandu-Post,"It was love at first sight. When Madhusha Angthupo Limbu saw Lorax Rai at a football practice session, the two immediately clicked with each other. As they got talking, Madhusha’s feelings grew stronger. But she was in denial, she said. “I didn’t know whether what I felt was just a friendly affection or a romantic attraction.” Before meeting Lorax, Madhusha didn’t know she was queer. Now, Madhusha and Lorax, who is a transgender man, have been married for three years. They live with Lorax’s family in Beldangi refugee camp in Jhapa. When they began their relationship back in July 2019, their lives took a drastic turn, resulting in two police cases, death threats, and an elopement to Kathmandu that left them vulnerable both mentally and financially. Though Nepal’s constitution guarantees the right to freedom and a life of dignity for gender and sexual minorities, it has not yet translated into societal practice, as queer individuals face discrimination, even violence at the hands of their own family members, the community and state institutions like the police . Some have also resulted in deaths, like in the case of Junu Gurung in 2019 and Ajita Bhujel in 2020, both of whom were trans women. The existing laws for people of marginalised sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics (PoMSOGIESC) have been criticised for being archaic and limiting —as the ‘third gender’ label often fails to address the larger queer spectrum . Moreover, despite provisions, queer folks have been denied equal rights in terms of education , health services and financial opportunities . How it all started Lorax, who was assigned female at birth, has always identified himself as a man. He was born in Beldangi, Jhapa, and his family accepted his masculine presentation from childhood. “I dressed up like a boy and liked doing traditionally masculine things,” he says. His parents, unlike many families who are unaccepting of queer values, let Lorax be himself without prejudice or judgement. Madhusha, who was born in a village near Beldangi, however, wasn’t so fortunate. When her parents found out she was in a relationship with Lorax, they were furious. “How can two girls be in a relationship? That’s what my family argued,” she says. After receiving threats and physical abuse, she ran away from home and joined Lorax at his home in Beldangi. One day, however, both were summoned by the police, who revealed that Madhusha’s parents had filed a police case condemning the couple’s union. “Her family members threatened and intimidated us at the police station, demanding that we never see each other again,” says Lorax. During the confrontation, there were even instances of physical violence. Kabita Tamang, the Koshi provincial coordinator of Mitini Nepal, an organisation that advocates for queer individuals, says that she can cite many examples wherein police cases are filed against queer couples. “Families often file kidnapping cases when, in truth, their children have run away from home because of abuse and discrimination they face for being queer,” Kabita says, adding that in the past, many LGTBIQA+ individuals were also sent to rehabilitation centres. The police in Beldangi sided with Madhusha’s family, which resulted in them being forced to sign a written document agreeing to stay away from each other. Back at home, Madhusha would be beaten up frequently, so after a month, she returned to Lorax’s home. Lorax Rai (left) and Madhusha Limbu. Photo: Courtesy of Lorax Rai Fearing for their lives, Lorax and Madhusha eloped to Itahari, where they stayed with a common friend Jewel Dhimal for a day. Then they met with Suman Tamang, a trans man, who hosted them for another day. “Both of them were scared and under a lot of stress,” says Suman, who runs a local organisation called ‘Sahara’ to spread awareness on LGBTIQA+ issues in Itahari of Sunsari and neighbouring districts. It was Suman and Jewel who got them in touch with Mitini Nepal. “With Mitini Nepal, we learned about gender identities and realised we were not alone,” says Lorax. Kabita says cases of elopement by queer folks aren’t uncommon. “We get several cases of elopements, many under-age,” she says. In the case of minors, the organisation often advises them to return home and finish their studies. If the threat is imminent, they are put in shelters. “As both Lorax and Madhusha were legal adults, the organisation let them decide for themselves,” she says. After receiving some counselling, the couple decided to go to Kathmandu, looking for greener pastures. Life in the Valley The couple settled in Kathmandu in the winter of 2019. Madhusha found work as a waitress in a local restaurant. But life in the Valley wasn’t too kind either. Both were just students back in Jhapa; they had difficulties sustaining themselves in the city. Given the stress of running away from home and receiving threats, both suffered mentally. “I got sick so many times,” Lorax recalls. “I had difficulty breathing and eating. I wasn’t in a good place.” According to a journal article published by the Nepal Medical Association, LGBTQI+ people are already at a greater reproductive, physical, and mental health risk, and the healthcare services offered to them are severely inadequate. One of the biggest obstacles to receiving healthcare services is the stigmatisation and discriminatory attitudes healthcare practitioners display, according to the article. As Lorax couldn’t find or afford mental health professionals who understood his experience, living in Kathmandu proved to be one of the bleakest times of his life, he says. Nonetheless, the couple decided to get married at a temple in Kathmandu on December 22, 2019. “That was one of the happiest days of my life,” Lorax says. But that happiness wouldn’t last long. Unable to find proper financial footing and in light of Lorax’s worsening health, they returned to Beldangi to Lorax’s family home in February 2020. Back in Beldangi Back home, things were normal for a while. Lorax’s family welcomed their daughter-in-law with open arms, calling her ‘nani.’ But Madhusha’s family members were still angry. One day, while walking in the nearby bazar, the couple was stopped and harassed by a group of individuals sent by Madhusha’s family. Soon, the police knocked on their door again, announcing another police complaint had been filed against them. Police referred the new case to Damak, says Madhusha. In Damak, the couple contacted Lead Nepal, an organisation fighting for LGBTIQA+ rights. Lead Nepal mediated their case with the police, arguing that both were legal adults—21 at the time—with the right to decide for themselves. Rubina Nepal, a monitoring and evaluation officer at Lead Nepal, remembers that the incident was very difficult for both Lorax and Madhusha. “Lorax had been slapped a few times by one of the attackers,” Nepal recalls. “Death threats were being thrown about in the station.” Sensing a danger to their lives, Lead Nepal crafted a minute at the police station stating that certain members of Madhusha’s family be held responsible should the couple be harmed in any way. It was only then that the agitating party backed off. The complaint against Lorax and Madhusha was finally dismissed. After the verdict, Madhusha’s family disowned her. “They said I’d brought them shame and wanted nothing to do with me,” she says. Calm after the storm Three years later, their life has taken a happier turn. They can now love each other freely and without fear. Though it took a while for them to feel safe stepping out of the house, Lorax and Madhusha now roam around the bazar as a couple. As Lorax’s parents often fall sick, both take turns doing household chores and rearing the pigs. The recent Supreme Court interim order to facilitate marriage registration for same-sex and non-heterosexual couples has them elated. Despite having married three years ago, their marriage was not legally recognised. “We’re now planning to register the marriage as soon as possible,” Madhusha says. However, queer activists argue that the issue isn’t out of the woods yet. “The registration is temporary till the proper mechanisms are built. We’re just worried the government might not keep the end of the bargain,” says Suman Tamang. Moreover, he believes that as long as queer couples aren’t given full equality in terms of marriage—from the registration, insurance, adoption, and even divorce and spousal support—biases against gender and sexual minorities will continue to persist in society. Anurag Devkota, a human rights lawyer, says that the interim order is simply the stepping stone to ensure marriage equality for queer folks as the final verdict is yet to come. If the final verdict rules for the legalisation of queer marriages, there would need to be an amendment to the Civil Code 2017 which dictates that a marriage is ‘concluded’ if a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’ accept each other as husband and wife. The use of gendered words like ‘man’ and ‘woman’ rules out the possibility of marriage between queer individuals.",https://kathmandupost.com/life--style/2023/07/01/family-hostility-social-obstacles-how-this-queer-couple-s-union-survives-hardships,life--style

Heading not Found,Janakraj Sapkota,"June 25, 2023",Kathmandu-Post,"Bharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘ tallo bato ’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average. The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown. To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million. During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways. Death of a dream Some of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu. While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell. Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million. Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!” Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.” Stories that echo each other The situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US. Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.” For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health. Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Tikaram Pun, 40, a resident of Bohora village in Musikot Municipality-4. Mahesh KC/TKP Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task. Those who died on the way A group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021. “I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.” Lack of political will and legal remedies The concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention. Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said. Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “ Meter byaji s [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added. The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said. One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law. According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency. SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added. On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control. Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure. While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.” ( Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report. ) This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal.",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/06/25/desperate-youths-from-maoist-heartland-hit-us-wall,national

Heading not Found,"Deepak Pariyar, Ramesh Kumar Paudel, Ghanashyam Gautam & Binod Bhandari","June 10, 2023",Kathmandu-Post,"Gyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications. BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy. “I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.” The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds. However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations. Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds. The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘ medical city’ as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office. “Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.” Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari. The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates. Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said. Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.” The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts. Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.” Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules. “I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.” Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/06/10/no-private-hospital-bed-for-poor-patients,national

The theme for this year’s World Environment Day, emphasising land restoration, combating desertification and building resilience to drought, encompasses the pressing issues of this era which need careful intervention. The scale and intensity of the impacts of land degradation, desertification and drought are alarming. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) states that up to 40 percent of the world’s land is degraded, adversely impacting around 3.2 billion people. Projections also indicate that over three-quarters of the world's population by 2050 will be affected by drought. These impacts manifest in several aspects of life and nature, including loss of biodiversity and ecosystems, depletion of resources, food insecurity, livelihood and ultimate human existence. In recent times, land degradation induced by physical, chemical and biological processes has been accelerated by human activities. The main culprits include haphazard infrastructure development, industrialisation, high carbon-intensive energy use, overgrazing and excessive extraction of natural resources without consideration of environmental sustainability. Prolonged droughts are becoming more common and climate change adds uncertainty and complexities to their occurrences. Nepal’s vulnerability Nepal’s young mountains are geologically fragile and complex. Located in a tectonically active zone, the whole land mass from the Himalayas in the North to the Siwalik in the South is susceptible to peculiar challenges, especially erosion, landslides and floods. Anthropogenic activities in this hazard-prone region, including haphazard infrastructure construction, land use change, and chemical fertiliser and pesticide overuse, exacerbate these natural phenomena. For instance, road construction on the slopes without due consideration to the environment and slope stabilisation in the last decade has increased incidents of landslides and slope failures. Excessive extraction of resources from rivers is another concern. While regulatory provisions in the Environment Protection Act and Regulation mandate comprehensive assessment, project developers often perceive such provisions as a burden. Limited focus on the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan, compliance monitoring and evaluation, and audits are the reasons behind haphazard resource extraction and the continuation of environmentally unsustainable projects. Soil loss through erosion, a serious threat to soil health, results in agricultural yield decline, ecosystem degradation, habitat destruction and several economic impacts. A 2016 study by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) estimated 40 million tons of soil loss between 1990 and 2010 in the Koshi basin. Identification of arable soil loss areas is critical for effective land management planning focused on conservation measures. The 61st report of the Office of the Auditor General pointed out that the content of soil organic matter currently stands at 2.83 against the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 3.37. Policy interventions A 2018 report titled “Land degradation neutrality target setting program in Nepal” set three targets to be achieved by 2030: i) Increase forest cover to 44.7 percent; ii) increase agricultural growth by 6 percent; iii) increase Soil Organic Carbon in forest and cropland by 1 percent per annum and iv) restoring 10 percent of wetland ecosystem out of 26277 sq. hectares of wetlands. Among these, Nepal’s success in increasing forest cover from 39.6 percent in 1993 to 44.74 percent in 2018 is praised all over the world as one of the best-case examples of sustainable forest management initiatives. Despite this achievement, the recent episodes of forest fires during the pre-monsoon period are worrisome. The attainment of other targets requires concentrated effort by building synergies and collaboration among national policies/strategies and different climate action programmes. For instance, Land Use Policy, Agriculture Development Strategy, Nepal Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and Climate Change Policy are required to be aligned on its objectives, strategies and programmes. At the programme level, for instance, the National Climate Change Support Programme, the National Adaptation Plan, and the President Chure Terai Madesh Conservation Programme need to focus on a collaborative approach; eliminating duplication and creating synergies among beneficiaries and outcome of this programme. Research on drought shows an increasing trend in both the intensity and frequency of drought occurrences. The impacts of drought are significantly higher in rain-fed agricultural regions like Nepal, which rely extensively on the monsoon. Droughts result in crop failures and food insecurity, which is why region-specific explorations of droughts are essential for effective drought monitoring and risk mitigation. A 2021 study indicated that summer drought events have increased fivefold in the central region, doubled in the eastern region, and not significantly changed in the western region of Nepal. These incidences have severe implications for vulnerable communities that are mostly dependent on subsentence agriculture for their livelihood. As a result, difficulty in local livelihoods prevails, which acts as a “push factor” leading to increased migration from rural to urban city centres and abroad. Soil health Healthy soil is the foundation not only of agricultural systems and food security but also of the existence of humans. So, data management should be a priority towards understanding and analysing the pattern, trend and hotspots of land degradation and droughts. Sustainable land management programmes should incorporate soil conservation and watershed management, soil fertility management and improvement, community forestry programmes, technology development, and research and development. Climate-smart agriculture and the implementation and monitoring of environmental management plans are equally important. For these programmes to be successful, functional coordination mechanisms and institutional arrangements are pivotal. Further, opportunities to tap climate finance for implementing adaptation programmes at the local level will be crucial. But the state alone cannot address the land degradation problem; rather, collaboration among all sectors and stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, and the general public, is essential for achieving the desired outcomes in restoring land, combating desertification and building drought resilience.",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/14/drought-land-and-livelihood,columns

Among these, Nepal’s success in increasing forest cover from 39.6 percent in 1993 to 44.74 percent in 2018 is praised all over the world as one of the best-case examples of sustainable forest management initiatives. Despite this achievement, the recent episodes of forest fires during the pre-monsoon period are worrisome. The attainment of other targets requires concentrated effort by building synergies and collaboration among national policies/strategies and different climate action programmes. For instance, Land Use Policy, Agriculture Development Strategy, Nepal Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and Climate Change Policy are required to be aligned on its objectives, strategies and programmes. At the programme level, for instance, the National Climate Change Support Programme, the National Adaptation Plan, and the President Chure Terai Madesh Conservation Programme need to focus on a collaborative approach; eliminating duplication and creating synergies among beneficiaries and outcome of this programme. Research on drought shows an increasing trend in both the intensity and frequency of drought occurrences. The impacts of drought are significantly higher in rain-fed agricultural regions like Nepal, which rely extensively on the monsoon. Droughts result in crop failures and food insecurity, which is why region-specific explorations of droughts are essential for effective drought monitoring and risk mitigation. A 2021 study indicated that summer drought events have increased fivefold in the central region, doubled in the eastern region, and not significantly changed in the western region of Nepal. These incidences have severe implications for vulnerable communities that are mostly dependent on subsentence agriculture for their livelihood. As a result, difficulty in local livelihoods prevails, which acts as a “push factor” leading to increased migration from rural to urban city centres and abroad. Soil health Healthy soil is the foundation not only of agricultural systems and food security but also of the existence of humans. So, data management should be a priority towards understanding and analysing the pattern, trend and hotspots of land degradation and droughts. Sustainable land management programmes should incorporate soil conservation and watershed management, soil fertility management and improvement, community forestry programmes, technology development, and research and development. Climate-smart agriculture and the implementation and monitoring of environmental management plans are equally important. For these programmes to be successful, functional coordination mechanisms and institutional arrangements are pivotal. Further, opportunities to tap climate finance for implementing adaptation programmes at the local level will be crucial. But the state alone cannot address the land degradation problem; rather, collaboration among all sectors and stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, and the general public, is essential for achieving the desired outcomes in restoring land, combating desertification and building drought resilience.",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/14/drought-land-and-livelihood,columns

The persistent gender disparities across various spheres of life—education, employment, healthcare, and beyond—are stark reminders of the structural barriers confronting women in Pakistan. Despite efforts, the nation consistently lags on gender parity indices, raising concerns about the adequacy and sufficiency of initiatives targeted at closing the gender gap. Placed 142nd out of 146 countries on the WEF’s 2023 Global Gender Gap Index, it is evident that significant strides are needed to address gender inequities in Pakistan. An examination of past budgetary allocations and policy documents unveils a persistent neglect of gender considerations, manifesting in inadequate resource allocation for women across crucial sectors. These systemic imbalances perpetuate gender inequalities, thwarting the full realisation of Pakistan’s human potential. Recent stabilisation policies have further tilted the scales against women due to discriminate access to formal capital markets, decent jobs, financial and digital tools, etc. As the new fiscal year approaches, it is imperative to remind the government of the gender issues that have only received perfunctory attention over the years. Policymakers must acknowledge that no economic recovery can be sustainable if half the country’s population is inhibited in its capacity to contribute productively, underscoring the need for gender-centric policies. While economic revival must remain a top priority, any effort towards this goal without adequate female representation is like building a house of cards. Sustainable economic recovery is contingent upon the mainstreaming of gender-centric policies across all sectors. This necessitates integrating the gendered impacts of policies into the planning process, rather than treating them as an afterthought. In this context, the federal and provincial budgets can be leveraged by respective governments to address disparities through gender-responsive budgeting. Gender Responsive Budget entails evaluating the gendered impacts of budgetary allocations, integrating gender equality in planning processes, and establishing monitoring mechanisms for greater accountability. The overarching goal is to ensure equitable distribution of resources for inclusive development. It is disconcerting that despite the widespread adoption of Gender Responsive Budget in many countries, including South Asian counterparts India and Bangladesh, Pakistan has yet to present a gender-responsive budget. As a first step, all PC-1 forms must incorporate a dedicated section obligating departments to thoroughly assess the gendered impacts of the proposed projects. Projects that help level the playing field should be prioritised over those that magnify distortions. Additionally, macroeconomic policies must only be implemented after carefully assessing their differential impacts on women. To further promote gender equity, several key demands must be addressed, including ensuring equal employment opportunities, pay equity, supporting women-owned businesses with financial incentives, and increasing funding for girls’ education, especially in underserved areas. Expanding maternal, reproductive, and mental health services, establishing affordable childcare facilities, and streng­thening laws and support services against gender-based violence are also essential, particularly in the face of climatic cha­l­lenges. Ad­­diti­o­­nally, enhancing social protection program­mes for more coverage, along with increasing digital and financial access is essential to promote equity. Greater representation of women in decision-making roles is of utmost import­ance. Currently, political representation seems confined to a few privileged women, often detached from the everyday challenges faced by the majority. This lack of representative female voices in the political arena results in the formation of ineffective policies that overlook critical gender issues. Developing mechanisms to facilitate participatory budgeting can help address this concern. The government must also prioritise data consolidation to support evidence-based policymaking. At present, the inadequate targeting of social programmes stemming from deficiencies in data undermines the effectiveness of initiatives. With limited fiscal space, the government must calibrate each and every budgetary allocation judiciously for maximised impact, for which data is key. In a nutshell, mainstreaming gender considerations across all sectors during the planning phase can enable policy-makers to significantly enhance the prospects for fairer, more inclusive economic resurgence. -Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/14/thinking-pink,columns

Heading not Found,Jagadish Prasad Bist,"June 14, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Nepal is in the hands of shortsighted and irrational decision-makers. Take, for example, the recent directive by Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to deploy traffic rule violators for traffic management. Thankfully, Lamichhane’s directive was overturned by the Supreme Court. The Kathmandu Road Division’s hasty decision to blacktop the road section the Kathmandu Metropolitan City had prepared for footpath extension is another example. It is striking how Lamichhane—a journalist-turned-politician and a former vocal critic of the ministers from parties he now aligns with—turned out no different. He is just as unscrupulous and power-hungry as the old guard, doing everything he can to remain in power and satisfy his political ambitions. Such a hunger for power leads him to make hasty and moody decisions, further augmenting the burden on the economy and society. This piece will analyse the economic cost of such decisions later, but first, let’s understand the reasons behind the pomposity of the leaders. One must understand political schooling to understand why Nepali politicians, new and old, formulate bizarre policies. What are the qualifications to become a politician, let alone a minister, in Nepal? It is anything but education and expertise. The current federal Cabinet of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and state and local level governments are not far from any of this. Most of them are no experts, nor do they hold the required knowledge to run their positions. The irony is that we have a government where a journalist becomes the home minister, a former rebel commander becomes the finance minister, and someone who lost the election becomes the minister of foreign affairs, home affairs, and physical infrastructure and transportation, all within a year under the same prime ministership. How can one person seamlessly transition between ministries overnight and suddenly become an expert in each field? Consequences The lack of proper education and thorough understanding of the policymakers’ responsibilities is causing serious problems at the policy level. This is the main reason for their narrow-mindedness—their inability to accept diversity and expert opinions—and to understand complex social and economic phenomena, which leads them to have a “holier-than-thou” and “I am the law” attitude. Huge economic costs and unnecessary social burdens come with that. Every economic policy comes with economic and social costs. Economic costs are of two types: Direct costs and opportunity costs. Direct costs are the actual tangible expenditures associated with implementing a policy and can be easily measured. Opportunity costs are implicit and come with forgone policy alternatives. These are difficult to measure, yet are crucial for policy evaluation, as they directly affect overall output or the economy. For example, had the home minister's recent ruling not been halted by the Supreme Court, it would have cost the nation an estimated Rs250 million a year. This calculation is based on the daily productivity of an individual ($1434/365) at the current exchange rate ( Rs133.25/USD ) and 1,300 incidences per day. The recent impulsive decision by the Road Department, under Raghuvir Mahaseth, to blacktop a section of the New Road, led to financial costs. If the minister were concerned about the people and the economy, he would have worked to speed up the construction of the remaining section of the Ring Road, which has far more important economic, social, and health and environmental concerns. As a result of these difficulties, households are bearing extra social costs, and the retail and service economies are losing productivity in the area due to a lack of proper infrastructure and environmental quality. Further, this will only increase the cost of production over time and reduce the country’s output because of fewer economic activities. Similarly, the former finance minister Janardan Sharma’s controversial tax policy and the current finance minister Barsha Man Pun's ineffective policy of distributing the budget for their cadres through popular programmes such as the Prime Minister Daughter Resilient Programme—when similar programmes like former PM KP Oli’s Prime Minister Employment Programme turned into white elephants—will add further burden. The inconsistency in the government’s policies, such as reducing tax last year and increasing this year on electric vehicles, shows a lack of understanding of the matter. These are just a few examples of irrational and farfetched laws and policies of the past and incumbent governments. The politicians’ behaviours and self-righteous actions put a huge economic, social and environmental toll on the nation. Additionally, policies that lead to the depletion of natural resources and allocation of public property to private politicians’ cronies result from the irresponsibility of the leaders. Not to forget, the decisions of the former government led by KP Oli to allow the commercialisation and export of natural resources from the Chure region and swap the land of the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate are no less concerning. There should be stringent mechanisms to control politicians’ reckless decisions. Though the Supreme Court has been overturning such steps, self-fulfilling politicians like those in the current and past governments remain a nuisance. Politicians must be made responsible for their deeds, even if they do not trigger corruption cases. Publicising cost-benefit analysis before formulating any such policies and regulations should be made mandatory. Otherwise, no matter whether the old or the new leaders make it to the government with their chicaneries, Nepal will continue to bear economic, social and environmental costs.",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/14/the-costs-of-leaders-irrational-decisions,columns

Heading not Found,Shrochis Karki,"June 13, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The Nepali cricket team’s second-ever T20 World Cup should have been a moment of joy but has turned into a dark crisis. But first, some introductions. Ever since I can remember, playing and watching cricket have been important parts of my identity. I have followed with joy the rise of Nepali cricket over the last 20 years. I am what you might call a fanatic. I never miss any Nepal match if I can help it, be it a friendly with a local club in India, a crunch qualifier against one of our nemesis associate nations, or a World Cup match against a Test nation. It does not matter what time zone a match is being played or where I am. I have also followed Sandeep Lamichhane’s career closely. He put Nepali cricket on the international map, and whether he played for the national team or some local T20 franchise, I tried to find a working link to be able to watch him play. I am establishing these credentials first because I expect fellow passionate Nepali cricket fans will rush to dismiss what comes next. But I want you to know that I love Nepali cricket just as much as you do, and so this is not part of some conspiracy to discredit Sandeep or Nepali cricket. Quite the opposite: I care about Nepali cricket too much to stay silent. At a time when populist stunts are rife, it feels necessary to speak truth to power, as an expression of love. Custodians of rape culture Much has been written about Sandeep’s Gaushala-26 rape case. As a rule of thumb, I choose to believe victims. The harassment she has faced—which culminated in her suicide attempt—beggars belief. She has remained steadfast against all pressure, rejecting advances to “settle” the case. It is hard to imagine why else anyone would willingly subject themselves to such inhumane treatment. This reflection, though, is not just about whether Sandeep raped Gaushala-26. My focus here is to examine Sandeep’s case as a textbook example of how our institutions perpetuate rape culture, where sexual abuse and violence are normalised. Custodian 1: The fans Ever since Sandeep has been accused, the vast majority of his fans have taken to social media to defend him, as well as to defame the victim. Perhaps it is no surprise in a deeply patriarchal society in the grips of populism, where hero worship has taken new heights. Sandeep is a hero to many, and apparently he can do no wrong. Or, even if he wrongs, he is still above the law because he can bowl a mean googly, and that’s what matters. These fans- mostly but not exclusively young men- are vocal in their support for Sandeep. Even when he was a convicted felon, never mind when he was just accused of being a rapist- that too potentially of a minor- cricket mattered more to his devotees. Such craze toward their favourite cricketer substantially sustained a rape culture where allegations of sexual abuse were relegated to oblivion. When an overwhelming, assertive, visible, and vitriolic population aggressively downplays rape charges, it extinguishes any hope victims might have in their elusive quest for justice. Custodian 2: The courts Every level of the court system has already weighed in on Sandeep’s case. The Supreme Court—in its infinite wisdom—allowed him to represent the national team and travel abroad while on trial for rape charges. Along with the Prime Minister, who found it fitting to felicitate Sandeep in the middle of his trial, the Supreme Court’s tacit endorsement of Sandeep has made a mockery of victims’ rights and cemented rape culture as the established norm in Nepal. The Kathmandu District Court was at least bold enough to convict Sandeep of rape, though it did not find the victim to be a minor, which would have led to more significant consequences for Sandeep. Knowledge sources had commented then that this was already paving the way for a successful appeal later, which soon came to pass. The High Court overturned that conviction, acquitting Sandeep of all charges. Almost instantaneously, the fans came out in droves and celebrated that decision. Social media is swarmed with comments about how if Sandeep was punished when convicted, he should be reinstated immediately now that he is acquitted. It is an open secret that the judiciary- like many other institutions in Nepal- is compromised. Power and privilege run deep, and decisions are not just made on the merits of the legal argument. To all the fans now celebrating Sandeep’s acquittal and making that the basis for his rehabilitation, I have just one question: If you are from a poor family and if your loved one is sexually assaulted by someone rich, powerful, or politically connected, do you genuinely expect our judicial system to impart justice and punish the perpetrator? Take a moment, put yourself in the shoes of Gaushala-26’s family, and reflect on this question. If you honestly believe that justice would be served, I have a bridge to sell you. Custodian 3: CAN and the cricketing fraternity The Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has towed a fine line, appearing to uphold the law in the strictest sense. As soon as Sandeep was convicted, CAN suspended him from all cricketing activities. He was only reinstated after he was acquitted by the High Court. Dig a bit deeper though, and rape culture rears its ugly head. Even while facing serious rape charges, CAN was not compelled by any sense of morality to prevent him from representing Nepal. Within moments of the High Court’s acquittal, CAN officials rushed to announce that Sandeep had been reinstated. They went above and beyond to lobby the US Embassy to grant him a visa on time. When that failed, they facilitated his travel to St. Vincent and the Grenadines for him to play the remaining matches. They have lobbied the International Cricket Council to ensure his inclusion while sacrificing another player from the squad. To be sure, CAN has faced incredible scrutiny and received intense pressure from “the fans” to back Sandeep. Yet, the rush to not only rehabilitate but actually elevate Sandeep demonstrates that CAN only saw the case as a nuisance. Even if the legal burden of proof might not have been met, CAN could and should have investigated whether Sandeep met the national team’s code of conduct, as has been customary in similar cases around the world. It should have taken time to study the decision, and it could have waited for the legal process to reach its logical conclusion; it is all but certain that a Supreme Court appeal will follow. What CAN has not done speaks volumes of how rape culture is sustained in Nepal. To my knowledge, no official has spoken publicly about whether Sandeep’s actions violated the expectations placed on national players, or expressed concern or solidarity for the victim. The reasons for Sandeep’s absence have been conveniently ignored, as if he has simply been on holiday or nursing a minor injury. Just as his absence was unexplained, so too has his return been left ‘unsaid’. The gaslighting of the entire saga shows the contempt with which the issue is treated in Nepal. The wider cricketing fraternity—which includes players, former players, coaches, commentators, sponsors, and officials—has, at best, adopted a veil of silence or, at worst, come out publicly in Sandeep’s support. Respected national and international commentators have found it convenient to use phrases such as “Sandeep is not available” when away and “Sandeep, the talisman of Nepali cricket, is back” now, without any mention of the dark context. A moment to engage with and educate a whole nation on how to take rape charges, and its victim, seriously has been left unaddressed. Because, of course, cricket comes first. A naïve hope I expect the backlash to this piece to be swift and severe. It feels poignant that I am travelling to watch Nepal play in the World Cup in the very matches Sandeep will now play. But his celebrated return has filled me with dread, anxiety, and disgust, to the point that I do not know how to support my beloved team anymore. Spare a thought for Gaushala-26 and for all victims of rape and rape culture. Regardless of the legalese, we must strive to build a culture where victims are empowered and supported to speak up and stand for the truth. Nepali cricket has always found a way through adversity, often miraculously. Our obsession with star power must be replaced with a focus on the role cricket, and citizens, should play in sustaining a culture of accountability and respect for victims. As amazing as it is, cricket is still only a game and must become a vehicle for good, not evil.",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/13/rape-culture-review-long-overdue,columns

Heading not Found,Rachel Killean,"June 13, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"In the face of horrific violence, the global community is turning towards criminal prosecution as a means to supposedly deliver justice for victims of atrocities committed in Ukraine, Sudan, Israel and Gaza. While bringing an immediate end to the violence remains the most urgent priority, the international community is also grappling with how to handle the step that comes after—recognising victims' right to justice. Increasingly, contemporary international law has framed ‘justice’ as being primarily delivered through criminal prosecutions, either at a domestic level or before an international tribunal such as the International Criminal Court (ICC). For example, in 2022 the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor began investigations into crimes associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and, in 2023, the European Union established a transnational body to gather evidence for any future prosecutions of the crime of aggression. The crime of aggression is committed when a leader of a country plans, prepares, initiates or executes an act of aggression by one country against another, and the work of the EU marks the first time active investigations into the crime of aggression are taking place while the armed conflict is ongoing. Sudan has been part of the ICC's mandate since 2005, and, in January 2024, ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan announced he has opened investigations into the renewed conflict. Although a 'preliminary examination' of the situation in Palestine has been open since 2015, it took until 2021 for hurdles around jurisdiction to be cleared. In May 2024, Khan declared his intent to seek arrest warrants for three senior members of Hamas, as well as the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant. This emphasis on prosecutions is understandable—when people see invasion and killings at such a scale, there's a want to find and hold accountable the people most responsible for it. But doing so through channels like the ICC risks over-simplifying and even undermining victims' rights to remedies, truth and justice. International criminal investigations are extremely complex and case preparation can take a long time. Investigators also rely on the cooperation of states to assist in accessing evidence and surrendering suspects. This is not always forthcoming. In the Palestinian case, the ICC is facing not only a lack of cooperation but firm opposition to its investigations from Israel and some of its most powerful allies (such as the United States). In the meantime, applying criminal law protections such as the presumption of innocence to states can run counter to victims' rights and interests. As legal scholars Natasa Mavronicola and Mattia Pinto argue, relying on criminal investigations means that powerful actors engaging in widespread atrocities are given the ‘benefit of the doubt' until alleged crimes are proven to criminal standards. Unexecuted arrest warrants, lengthy investigations and obstructed proceedings all risk justice delayed becoming justice denied. This becomes more pronounced in cases such as Palestine, where victims have lived through generations of violence. The experiences of previous international criminal tribunals emphasise this point—former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic dying in 2006 while on trial in The Hague denied his victims the closure of a verdict. In Cambodia, the lengthy proceedings and delays in pursuing prosecutions at the Khmer Rouge Tribunal meant two accused war criminals died before they could be put on trial, and many victims passed away before they were able to benefit from the reparations delivered along with the Tribunal's judgments. Former UN Special Rapporteur Philip Alston has argued that focusing on criminal prosecutions also inevitably means focusing on individual perpetration. While criminal accountability can certainly matter to victims, individualising atrocity crimes can create de-contextualised versions about the ‘truth' of what happened, overlooking the ‘banality of evil' that enables atrocities to take place. Shifting the focus from state responsibility to individual liability can also problematically curtail calls for more substantial forms of redress and repair. Victims of violations under international law have rights, enshrined by the UN in 2005. The code outlines what victims are entitled to, including dignified and humane treatment, equal and effective access to justice, adequate, effective and prompt reparation for harm suffered, and access to relevant information concerning violations and reparation mechanisms. That same year, the UN also produced updated Principles to Combat Impunity. These require states to combat impunity for human rights violations and acknowledge victims' right to know the truth about what happened. While the ICC, for example, allows victims to participate and submit claims for reparations, its practice has meant that states are absolved from taking responsibility. Yet the reparations available at the ICC may fail to address their needs. The turn to the International Court of Justice as a site for challenging violence in Ukraine and Gaza has offered opportunities for accountability and truth that focus on state responsibility. However, any decision by the Court will require enforcement, and this raises implementation challenges. Pathways to justice for victims Holistic responses to atrocities are required to recognise and enforce victims' rights. Justice for victims won't just flow from prosecuting perpetrators, but instead needs to be considered within the suite of interventions that can deliver redress and truth. The field of ‘transitional justice' offers suggestions as to what this might involve. The UN has described transitional justice as encompassing a range of international and/or domestic measures, such as ‘individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform… or a combination.' At their best, transitional justice measures are grounded in the wishes and needs of victims and tailored to the specific context. While less headline grabbing than ICC investigations, academics and practitioners are exploring how transitional justice mechanisms might be applied to Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza. These mechanisms also pose challenges. It is important not to over-simplify the histories behind these conflicts, or the risk of ongoing subjugation in the aftermath of any ceasefire. As law professor Matiangai V. S. Sirleaf notes, ignoring the ""enduring presence of historical racial and colonial violence is something the field of transitional justice initiatives ignore at their peril."" Nevertheless, while nothing can be more important than bringing violence to an end, taking victims' rights and claims to justice seriously can play an important role in reaffirming victims' dignity and humanity. -360info",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2024/06/13/victims-rights-and-criminal-prosecution,columns

After all, the government has money to spend, and contractors have work to finish to claim that money. But such hurried spending has a major problem: The work being done is substandard. The road that was blacktopped overnight to meet the spending deadline of this financial year will hardly last until the end of the next financial year. Between June 10 and July 15, 2020, the capital spending jumped by 17 percent in the last month of the fiscal year as the government rushed to increase such expenditure. Before the rush, the capital expenditure had been just 30 percent in the first 11 months of that fiscal year. In FY 2020/21, the government spent 21 percent of the total budget in a single month, between mid-June and mid-July. As of June 12, a little over a month before the end of FY 2023/24, capital expenditure was a mere 44 percent, which means that the government has failed to spend the budget allocated, making it difficult to meet the development targets. Experts blame bureaucratic red tape for the delay in capital expenditure, as it takes months for even small amounts of bills to be cleared. Moreover, projects are often initiated randomly without ensuring the financial resources, leading to failure to move them forward. Previous governments tried to address the problem through budget implementation guidelines. Last year, the government made it mandatory to complete the call for bids and contract signing of projects by mid-November and begin work within 15 days of the signing. It said the plans and programmes that failed to meet this deadline would not get any budget. The 81-point budget implementation guideline has specific provisions on project completion timeline, payment, budget transfers and other matters of financial discipline. The government cannot maintain a lacklustre attitude when it comes to capital expenditure, as it has a detrimental effect on the country’s overall development. It is time to streamline the monitoring, evaluation and payment systems to ensure that the government’s plans and programmes move forward and are completed within the stipulated deadline. The last-minute spending rush should become a thing of the past—which will also be a solid proof of the government’s commitment to improving people’s lives through judicious spending.",https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/12/better-early,editorial

Heading not Found,Author not Found,"June 11, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"When it arrives, it can bring both bounty and bane. However, due to a changing climate, monsoons in recent times have invariably resulted in more hardship than help. This monsoon, which arrived in Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual date, will certainly buoy farmers and provide much-needed relief from the blistering heat, but concerns over its severity still loom large. Experts have predicted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures. As this will exacerbate floods, landslides and epidemics, disaster preparedness becomes crucial. Our responses to natural disasters have consistently fallen short. Governments come and go, but the same pattern repeats every year, and hundreds of lives, and a whole lot of properties and physical infrastructure are left at nature’s mercy. Not that the country has no plans and policies for disaster preparedness. This year, as in previous ones, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has devised the Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan, which is commendable. The necessary logistics and emergency relief materials have also been stockpiled in all provinces, according to officials. The problem, however, is with the execution of these plans. This monsoon is estimated to put 1.81 million people and 412,000 households at risk, and require 18,000 rescues. These numbers are large, suggesting the necessity for a comprehensive response to disasters and ensuring that relief programmes reach the most vulnerable and needy. Lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels has also caused several problems during disasters. Local governments play a big role as primary rescuers in floods and landslides, but they are still far short in human and financial resources. The examples from the earthquake-devastated Rukum West, Sindhupalchowk and several other places highlight how Nepal fails to rehabilitate the disaster-displaced people for long periods. The residents of Rukum West are still obliged to live in houses with cracks and fissures, and experts warn that these houses could be badly damaged this monsoon. There is also high risk to those living in high landslide and flood prone areas. Unless we design approaches that include not only immediate relief programmes but also year-round relocation, rehabilitation, monitoring and study, people will continue to suffer. Also, proactive measures like public awareness and early warning should be strengthened. Moreover, monsoons are notorious for water- and vector-borne diseases, including dengue, cholera and typhoid. Dengue cases are already being reported from different parts of the country and the caseload will likely increase during and after the monsoon. Water resource contamination has surged in the past few months, leading to a higher number of water-borne disease cases in hospitals. During the monsoon preparedness, the authorities shouldn’t overlook these epidemics and focus particularly on areas that are more prone to diseases and, therefore, need timely healthcare intervention and workers. A coordinated effort from health, home, urban development and water supply ministries can help make this monsoon a lot safer. In the long run, we should find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, which has exacerbated our climatic conditions and intensified disasters. Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on weather will help us better prepare for future monsoons and the disasters that come in their wake.",https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/11/enter-monsoon,editorial

Heading not Found,Author not Found,"June 11, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal inaugurated its second general convention on Monday. The Upendra Yadav-led party is holding the mega event at a time the party has suffered multiple setbacks. Seven of its 12 federal lawmakers split the JSP-Nepal and registered a new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—at the Election Commission last month. The party of Upendra Yadav, who headed the party that had continuously led Madhesh provincial government since 2018, has been pushed to the opposition bench in the provincial assembly. Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and health minister in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet until last month, has been ousted from the federal government as well. Despite such adverse circumstances, Yadav is poised to be the party chief again, most likely unopposed. Yadav rose to power after successfully spearheading a Madhesh movement in 2007 demanding rights for the historically marginalised Madheshi people. Though the demand for federalism had been raised by various quarters even in the past, it was Yadav-led agitation that eventually forced the Nepali state to introduce the federal system in the country. He formed Madheshi Janadhikar Forum-Nepal under his own leadership. Since then he has always been at the helm of a party. He has merged his party with various outfits, multiple times, only to split again. With the rise of Madheshi parties in the aftermath of the second people’s movement in 2006, people—not only from the southern belt of the country but also from most marginalised communities—had high hopes for a paradigm shift in Nepali politics. The big parties traditionally holding power, namely the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, had felt pressure. But within years of their joining governments in Kathmandu, people were disenchanted by their performance. A section of people expected that the regional parties would do better when allowed to lead provincial governments. They failed in the province as well. In Nepal, communist leaders and parties have been infamous for persistent disputes and divisions, mostly after the 1990 political change. When parties mushroomed in Madhesh, they beat the communists in terms of infightings and divisions. There is not a single party in Madhesh that remained intact, which is disappointing for those who expected that regional forces would build pressure on traditional forces through better delivery. Mismanagement, lack of organisational discipline, non-transparency and top leaders’ monopoly in decision-making have become common traits of Madhesh-based parties. Big parties such as the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre are criticised for being monopolistic and rather undemocratic. But, newer forces proved themselves worse. For instance, at least the big parties have been holding their general conventions as per the constitutional provision. Their provincial, district and village units are also elected through a process. For example, the UML is now electing its district leaders through conventions. When they fail to pick leaders in consensus, they readily go for a vote. Top leaders may favour those loyal to them but even these loyalists must nonetheless follow the process. That is why the UML is considered the most organised party in the country. The Congress also follows at least basic democratic norms while electing its leaders and making important decisions. But we don’t see the same in Madhesh-based and other newly emerged forces. This is unfortunate. Only political parties that are well-organised, democratic and transparent in their activities will have the moral strength to mount pressure on big forces. Those who can’t maintain democracy and transparency in their own organisations can’t ensure it in the government when they come to power. We hardly find any leader in Madhesh handing over party leadership to other leaders through a democratic process. We hope that in the ongoing convention Yadav’s JSP-Nepal can bring policies to make the party organisation more transparent and democratic.",https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/11/chart-your-own-path,editorial

No matter how good their PR skills are, it takes time and effort to cultivate good working relations with the officials of their host countries. When a country constantly chops and changes its ambassadors, diplomacy becomes difficult. Nepali political parties have a wretched record of abruptly recalling ambassadors appointed by the previous coalition governments. But Thursday's silly recall of Dr Shankar Sharma, Nepali ambassador to India, must be the most egregious of them all. The Cabinet decided to recall Sharma days ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s New Delhi visit to attend the third swearing-in of Narendra Modi as India’s prime minister. Why couldn’t Dahal have waited until he got back from New Delhi? With what authority would an ambassador that his prime minister clearly does not trust coordinate his India trip? Why the rush, one wonders. Of course, it is natural for a new government to want to appoint those it can rely on as the country’s envoys. But then our envoys are Nepal’s representatives abroad, whose conduct can make or break the country’s image. This is why only the most capable of them should make the cut. And if the best of the best are chosen, they should be allowed to work for the four full years. This time, the government has recalled not just its Indian ambassador but also its envoys from 10 other countries, including the US and the UK. Notably, these envoys were appointed by the same prime minister before he changed his main coalition partner, from the Nepali Congress to the CPN-UML. This is unfortunate. Political instability has had a devastating impact on Nepali economy as it now struggles to achieve even a modest 4 percent annual growth. It has destroyed our domestic institutions. The same instability is now also affecting our standing abroad. If Nepal’s major political actors cannot send a message of unity and purpose to the rest of the world, how will others trust us? Why would they come and invest in Nepal? Our relations with major powers like India and the US are not things to be trifled with, at a time of heightened geopolitical competition in the region. In these contested times, the only way Nepal can safely navigate the choppy geopolitical waters is through mature diplomacy. Appoint the right people in the right capitals and give them a free hand. What is particularly strange about the most recent recall of 11 ambassadors is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to have been bypassed, as the decision was apparently made against the advice of Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha. This is not the first time that the advice of the foreign ministry has been sidelined. The diplomatic code of conduct is widely ignored and the ministry continues to be kept out of the loop as our top leaders engage with their foreign counterparts. Again, even if the ambassadors are to be appointed on political quotas (which they ideally should not), there can be a political understanding to pick the best of the lot and to let them serve out their term. Unless that happens, political instability at home will continue to harm Nepal's foreign conduct, with grave consequences for the Nepali national interest.",https://kathmandupost.com/editorial/2024/06/09/undiplomatic-conduct,editorial

Heading not Found,Thira Lal Bhusal,"June 10, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Prithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post ’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system. The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem? We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup. Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions? They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience? Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same. The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders? Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes. How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin? We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP What are the major flaws to be fixed? There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors. Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system. The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies. As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure? Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help? This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that. At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view? I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress. Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden? In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform . There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces.",https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/06/10/problem-lies-in-politicians-not-provinces,interviews

But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams. But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government. This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. Deepak KC/TKP It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction. But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money. Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane. But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes? There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this. Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him? Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Deepak KC/TKP Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position. Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges. When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude? This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation. Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation? I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Deepak KC/TKP Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash. This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty. What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis? In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report. Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction? We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement.",https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/06/02/there-can-be-a-separate-report-if-ruling-parties-try-to-impose-their-majority,interviews

Heading not Found,Binod Ghimire,"May 26, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post , Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here? Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend. For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. Angad Dhakal/TKP You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation? We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights. We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority. Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated? Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected. We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology. Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Angad Dhakal/TKP Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps? Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings. Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward? Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice. You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense. Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead. We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act. Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape. What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency. We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Angad Dhakal/TKP Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery? There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe. Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked? Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice. Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal? Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands. We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming. However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds. Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.",https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/05/26/people-are-now-listening-to-democratically-elected-authoritarian-leaders,interviews

Heading not Found,Thira Lal Bhusal,"May 19, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"The CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post ’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer? Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues. What were those policy disputes? We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership? For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices. Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start. You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies? The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention. A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand. There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party? This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society. Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre. We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer. But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance. While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance? The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML. Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time. As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance? Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions. Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning? Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition.",https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/05/19/if-oli-continues-to-manoeuvre-there-might-be-other-coalitions,interviews

Heading not Found,Anil Giri,"May 12, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post ’s Anil Giri . You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation. Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300. Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories. Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community. As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development. Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’. Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas. Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments. The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment. As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery. Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process. For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves. We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations. Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace. How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.",https://kathmandupost.com/interviews/2024/05/12/no-stone-should-be-left-unturned-to-ensure-justice-for-conflict-victims,interviews

Heading not Found,Arjun Poudel,"June 13, 2024",Kathmandu-Post,"Most districts, especially in the hills and Tarai, have been sweltering under extreme heat for the last several days, with temperatures soaring up to 45 degrees Celsius. However, the districts of Koshi province have been spared from this scorching weather. Several weather stations, including those at Changunarayan Bhaktapur, Chautara of Sindhupalchok, Tikapur of Kailali, Dharan of Sunsari, and Sarlahi, broke all previous records of maximum temperatures this year. Temperatures exceeding 33 degrees Celsius over the past several days have made life difficult in the Kathmandu valley, with many residents complaining about the heat. On Wednesday, the temperature climbed to 34.3 degrees Celsius in Kathmandu. Met officials said that hot and dry conditions will continue for the next couple of days, as monsoon rains are not expected to arrive in the Valley anytime soon. “Monsoon rain is a must for the Valley to cool down, but it is unlikely to arrive in the next two days,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecasting Division. “Temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius for several days have made the Valley hotter.” According to the Met Department data, the weather station at Changunarayan in Bhaktapur recorded 34.4 degrees Celsius on May 31, the highest temperature ever recorded here. Kathmandu had recorded 36.6 degrees Celsius on May 7, 1989. Tikapur of Kailali recorded 45.2 degrees Celsius on May 30, the highest temperature in the country this year. Likewise, Dharan recorded 40 degrees Celsius on April 28, and Sarlahi recorded 43 degrees Celsius; both are the highest temperatures recorded for those places, according to the Met department. Monsoon clouds entered the country from eastern Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Since then, districts of eastern Nepal have been witnessing rainfall. Met officials say it used to take two days for the monsoon clouds to arrive in the Valley after their arrival in eastern Nepal and around a week to spread throughout the country. However, last year, it took some three weeks for rainfall to occur in western and far-western Nepal. “Due to climate change, the weather has become more unpredictable,” said Manandhar. “The monsoon that entered eastern Nepal two days ago should have reached the Valley by Wednesday, but it may take a few more days.” The Met Office issued a heat wave warning for western and farwestern Tarai following the onset of monsoon. Officials said that they may have to issue more such warnings in the coming days due to the slow progression of the monsoon towards the western parts of the country. “It is not possible to come out in the afternoon due to the extreme heatwave conditions,” Dr Sanket Kumar Risal, information officer at Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, told the Post over the phone. “The hospital is also packed with patients suffering from fever and water-borne diseases. Even groundwater sources are shrinking in our areas. It now takes several hours for the water tank to fill up, which previously took just an hour.” On Wednesday Dhangadhi recorded 43.9 degrees Celsius, followed by Nepalgunj (42.2°C), Birendranagar (41.1 °C), Bhairahawa (40.4 °C), Ghorahi (39.5°C), and Dipayal (40.8 °C). The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. Last year, it started on June 14, one day later than the normal onset day. A normal monsoon, supported by the timely arrival of rain, translates into favourable agricultural production, mainly of paddy, and is further linked with the country’s overall economic growth. The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw. The Met Office has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events, such as flooding, inundation, and landslides. The department’s climate section has forecast weather conditions for four months (June to September). It said most parts of the country are likely to experience above-average minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall due to weakened El Nino conditions, and the development of La Nina conditions. El Nino conditions are the climatic patterns in which the surface water warms, unusually. The opposite, the cooling of the ocean surface, happens in the La Nina conditions. Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half. Evidence suggests the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average of a rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short time, continuous rain for several days post-monsoon, dry spells and droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal temperatures in winter—have become more frequent in Nepal.",https://kathmandupost.com/weather/2024/06/13/valley-sizzles-as-temperature-persists-over-30-degrees,weather
